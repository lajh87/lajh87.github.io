<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li>The chapter reviews literature on defence contracts and competitive procurement, exploring various contract types and the decision-making processes in defence equipment acquisition.</li>
<li>The complexity of contracting involves transaction costs related to acquiring information, organizing competitions, bargaining, and enforcing contracts.</li>
<li>The government, as a buyer or principal, must specify requirements and ensure that contractors pursue the principal’s goals.</li>
<li>Contracts that cannot detail all buyer requirements may lead to discretionary behaviour by contractors, influenced by their preferences.</li>
<li>Monitoring and enforcing contracts require measurable outputs, and incentives and penalties in contracts impact the behaviour of agents.</li>
<li>The chapter reviews traditional approaches to defence contracting, cost-estimating relationships, and various contract types, including recent theoretical developments.</li>
<li>Focus is given to market features, agent behaviour, and responses to contractual incentives and regulatory constraints.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="market-failure" class="level1">
<h1>2.1 Market Failure</h1>
<ul>
<li>Defence equipment markets function similarly to other markets by connecting buyers (defence ministries and armed forces) with sellers (defence industries).</li>
<li>The demand for defence equipment comes from national defence ministries, armed forces, and overseas governments, while defence industries, both nationally and internationally, supply the equipment.</li>
<li>The interaction between demand and supply is formalized through legally binding contracts, where buyers commit to paying a specified price for a product delivered on time.</li>
<li>Governments, acting as buyers, may impose regulatory requirements on contractors, such as profit controls, adding a layer of oversight.</li>
<li>The text introduces Figure 5.1, illustrating the market situation with a UK example.</li>
<li>Despite similarities, defence equipment markets have unique characteristics, including the central role of * governments, cost trends, technical progress, cost curves, and regulatory aspects.</li>
<li>The government’s role is crucial in determining technical progress, choosing equipment, and deciding whether to import or buy domestically.</li>
<li>Cost trends indicate that defence equipment, especially high-tech items, tends to become costlier over time.</li>
<li>Technical progress is a distinctive feature, leading to new products and markets, but also resulting in a smaller number of large firms dominating high-tech sectors.</li>
<li>Cost curves show that production costs of defence equipment increase over time, leading to downward pressures on the size and structure of armed forces.</li>
<li>Regulation plays a significant role in defence markets, with governments determining market openness, monitoring costs, and regulating profits on defence contracts.</li>
<li>The text refers to previous work by Peck and Scherer in 1963, highlighting the enduring relevance of these considerations in defence equipment markets.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Government Influence in Defence Markets and Policy Objectives.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>As a monopsonist, the government determines technical progress by choosing equipment and decides whether to import or buy domestically.</li>
<li>Government influence extends to determining the size and composition of its domestic defence capabilities.</li>
<li>The choice of defence equipment, including combat aircraft, missiles, submarines, and tanks, impacts the industry’s structure, entry and exit, prices, exports, and profits.</li>
<li>Some advocate for an interventionist approach, using defence procurement to support “key” technologies and back industry winners as part of national industrial policy.</li>
<li>Supporters of free markets, such as Austrian economists, criticize this interventionist stance, emphasizing the uncertainty of the future and the unintended consequences of government involvement.</li>
<li>Public choice analysis predicts potential government failures in efforts to improve economic performance.</li>
<li>The use of defence procurement as an instrument of industrial policy raises fundamental questions about the objectives of defence policy.</li>
<li>Questions arise regarding whether defence procurement aims at efficiently acquiring equipment for national defence or pursuing broader economic and social objectives, including protecting the national defence industrial base.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Challenges of Rising Costs in Defence Equipment and Adaptive Procurement Policies.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>High technology defence equipment is costly and experiencing rising costs in real terms.</li>
<li>Examples include the estimated $35 billion cost for fifteen American B2 stealth bombers and approximately $130 million per copy for the US F-22 advanced tactical fighter aircraft (1991-2 prices).</li>
<li>Despite increased costs, new equipment is more productive than previous generations.</li>
<li>Real unit production costs of defence equipment, including aircraft, helicopters, missiles, warships, and submarines, increase by about 10 percent per annum.</li>
<li>This cost trend implies a doubling in cost approximately every 7.25 years.</li>
<li>Defence budgets often fail to match these cost increases, leading to downward pressures on the size and structure of armed forces.</li>
<li>There is a need to reshape defence industries supplying the forces, evident in long-term trends like a one-ship navy and a one-aircraft air force.</li>
<li>Efforts are made to address these challenges through adaptive procurement policies, such as competition policy, aiming to postpone some of the adjustment effects associated with rising costs.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Evolution of Defence Equipment Markets and the Impact of Technical Progress.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Technical progress is a distinctive feature of defence equipment markets.</li>
<li>Major advances, such as in jet engines, missiles, electronics, and helicopters, create new markets.</li>
<li>Firms must invest in new development and production facilities with a focus on research and development (R &amp; D).</li>
<li>Since 1945, there’s a long-term trend towards fewer, larger firms, seen through mergers and exits from the defence sector.</li>
<li>High technology sectors, like aerospace and avionics, often have one or a few large national suppliers, forming a monopoly or oligopoly.</li>
<li>This market structure deviates significantly from the economists’ model of perfect competition.</li>
<li>Defence spending cuts in the USA, UK, and the EU during the 1990s contribute to exits from the industry and restructuring around fewer large defence contractors.</li>
<li>EU states may maintain competition by opening their national markets to foreign suppliers.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Economies of Scale and Competitiveness in High Technology Defence Sectors.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Some defence industries, especially high-tech sectors, exhibit decreasing costs, emphasizing economies of scale.</li>
<li>A national market in such sectors may only support one firm, resembling a monopoly.</li>
<li>Quantity becomes a critical factor in determining unit costs and overall competitiveness.</li>
<li>Long production runs allow for spreading high fixed research and development (R &amp; D) costs over a larger volume.</li>
<li>Scale and learning economies in production contribute to cost efficiency and competitiveness in high-tech defence sectors.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Government Regulation and Profit Controls in Defence Markets.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Defence markets and industries are subject to government regulation.</li>
<li>Governments have the authority to determine whether national markets should be open or closed.</li>
<li>Monitoring costs and profit controls on defence contracts are common regulatory practices.</li>
<li>Profit controls aim to prevent excessive profits or losses on defence business and maintain a domestic industrial base.</li>
<li>Profit levels may not serve as a standard signalling mechanism for entry or exit due to regulatory constraints.</li>
<li>Profit-conscious firms may adapt by increasing expenditure on unregulated items, such as luxury offices, company cars, and hoarding scientists and engineers.</li>
<li>The Tisdell and Hartley (1981) reference provides further insights into microeconomic policy in this context.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="demand-procurement-policy" class="level1">
<h1>2.2 Demand: procurement policy</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Procurement Policy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Represents the demand side of the defence equipment market.</li>
<li>Involves choices, with defence contracts being one element in the choice set.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Equipment Choices:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Implications for technical progress.</li>
<li>Involves choosing between competing demands from armed forces with a limited defence budget.</li>
<li>Decisions often made on the principle of “Buggin’s Turn.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Choice of Contractor:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Selection based on direct negotiation or competition.</li>
<li>Market can be restricted to domestic firms or open to foreign suppliers.</li>
<li>Public choice analysis predicts opposition from domestic firms against foreign suppliers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Choice of Contract:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Options include firm or fixed-price contracts, cost-plus contracts, or intermediate arrangements.</li>
<li>Firm price contracts have no variations, while fixed-price contracts allow for agreed variations.</li>
<li>Cost-plus contracts can lead to inefficiency, cost escalation, and “gold-plating.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Incentives to Choose:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Efficient solutions depend on incentives and penalties in employment contracts of procurement staff.</li>
<li>Lack of inducements to economize may lead to overspending.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Decision-Making Process:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Equipment choices often made by a committee.</li>
<li>Committee size, objectives, composition, chairman’s background, and voting arrangements are crucial.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Public Choice Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Predicts government policies favouring producers over consumers in defence contracting.</li>
<li>Budget-maximizing bureaucracies are expected to be inefficient.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Economist’s Evaluation of Procurement Policy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Traditional application of standard economic models of free trade and competition.</li>
<li>Competitive bidding opportunities considered in various project life cycle stages.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Historical Context:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Pioneering contributions in microeconomics of defence emerged in the 1960s, particularly by American economists, with the Rand Corporation in the forefront.</li>
<li>Hitch and McKean’s classic text briefly covered defence contracting in 1960.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="competition-firm-behavior-bargaining-and-contract-types" class="level1">
<h1>2.3 Competition, firm behavior, bargaining, and contract types</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Weapons Acquisition Process: Economic Incentives (Scherer, 1964)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Defines economic aspects of defence contracting.</li>
<li>Serves as a benchmark for subsequent developments in defence contracting theory and policy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Features of the Weapons Acquisition Process:</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>Development work involves uncertainty, shifting financial risks from contractors to the government.</li>
<li>Contractors gain specialized information and assets, leading to a bilateral monopoly bargaining situation.</li>
<li>Conventional market system not feasible; relies on a non-market, quasi-administrative relationship.</li>
<li>Government intervention required through controls or incentive mechanisms for successful acquisition.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Incentives:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Can be competitive (via breakout and second sourcing) or contractual.</li>
<li>Breakouts in the 1960s showed price reductions of 20% compared to non-competitive negotiations.</li>
<li>Second sourcing involves selecting multiple firms to produce a weapon system, reducing costs but not without challenges.</li>
<li>Contractual incentives used for monitoring and policing contractors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Defence Contract Agreement:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reflects preferences of government procurement agency and contractor.</li>
<li>Governments aim to balance contractor efficiency incentives, risk of excessive profits, and contract outlays.</li>
<li>Conflict between fixed-price contracts (efficiency vs.&nbsp;profit risk) and cost reimbursement contracts (minimize profit risk but remove efficiency incentives).</li>
<li>Incentive contracts provide a compromise solution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Negotiation Process:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Contractor’s knowledge of costs gives them a bargaining advantage.</li>
<li>Government can use competition from national or foreign firms to check on a contractor’s price bid.</li>
<li>Incompleteness in contracts may allow contractors to make cost-quality trade-offs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bargaining Dynamics:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Outcome reflects bargaining power, strategies, and tactics of both parties.</li>
<li>Contractors seek favourable cost and price targets, shifting risks and maximizing profits.</li>
<li>Government has power through competition, but contractor knowledge of costs remains a challenge.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="cost-estimating-relationships" class="level1">
<h1>2.4 Cost-estimating relationships</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose of Cost Estimates:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Used by industry and defence procurement agencies for planning, bidding, and checking cost estimates.</li>
<li>Applied in the initial planning phase, firm’s project bids, and validation of cost estimates by defence agencies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reliability of Early Estimates:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Early estimates for advanced technology defence projects are typically unreliable.</li>
<li>Studies show projects often experience a 40-70% real cost increase from initial estimates to completion.</li>
<li>Cost escalation attributed to modifications, changes in requirements, technical uncertainties, and contractor optimism.</li>
<li>Governments’ belief in awarding contracts to the lowest bidder may contribute to cost escalation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges in Early Cost Estimates:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Low estimates may create conditions for cost escalation.</li>
<li>Recognizes the unreliability of early cost estimates, suggesting the need for better techniques or alternative procurement policies.</li>
<li>Caution recommended as no single method or strategy suits all situations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Methods for Cost Estimation:</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>Engineering estimates</li>
<li>Comparative methods</li>
<li>Parametric methods</li>
<li>Learning curves</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Engineering Estimates:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Based on estimated costs of materials, equipment, components, labour, and overheads.</li>
<li>Fox (1974) and Sissons (1986) referenced in this method.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Comparative Methods:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Relies on historical comparisons of similar projects (e.g., combat aircraft, transport aircraft).</li>
<li>Graphs show trends over time, such as the positive and increasing trend in technical man hours per pound of empty weight for UK combat aircraft development work.</li>
<li>Rules of thumb used for estimating development cost to unit production cost ratios (e.g., 1,000:1 for guided weapons, 100:1 for combat aircraft with an existing engine).</li>
<li>Rules of thumb also applied to estimate life-cycle costs, considering acquisition and ownership costs (R&amp;D, production, operating, maintenance, and disposal costs).</li>
<li>UK evidence provides specific ratios for warships and combat aircraft life cycle costs.</li>
<li>Caution advised in using rules of thumb, as adjustments may be needed for variations in program complexity compared to “typical” projects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Parametric Methods:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Forecast future R&amp;D project costs based on cost profiles of historical R&amp;D project data.</li>
<li>Project R&amp;D costs front-loaded, rising steeply toward midpoint, then falling with production.</li>
<li>Optimal control model by Cavin (1991) aligns with empirical data.</li>
<li>Multiple regression analysis used in parametric methods, often from US Rand Corporation.</li>
<li>Log-linear equations estimate engineering and manufacturing hours based on aircraft weight, speed, and production quantity.</li>
<li>Rand study identifies most accurate cost-estimating relationships based on empty weight and speed.</li>
<li>Changes in technology, materials, and design concepts may affect conventional cost-estimating relationships.</li>
<li>Similar models developed for estimating cost changes in US Navy ship-building programs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Learning Curves:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Apply to production programs and used for cost-estimating and contract negotiations.</li>
<li>Reflect productivity increase with experience, expressed as y = aX^-b.</li>
<li>80% learning curve indicates 20% decline in direct labour inputs for each doubling of cumulative output.</li>
<li>Distinction between unit and cumulative average learning curves.</li>
<li>Examples of labour learning curves based on European experience shown in table 5.1.</li>
<li>Evidence of learning limit, especially for warships, occurring between four and twelve units.</li>
<li>Learning curves not unit cost curves; effect on unit production costs depends on the share of labour costs.</li>
<li>Challenges in estimating parameters (a and b), uncertainty about continuous learning, and potential impacts of modifications on learning.</li>
<li>Various hypotheses exist about operator and management learning, machine-intensive operations, assembly work, labour turnover, and payment systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Deficiencies in Cost-Estimating Relationships:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lack of quality industrial economics case studies in defence industries.</li>
<li>Need evidence on long-run average cost curves, minimum efficient scale, relative position of cost curves between nations, and the relationship between scale and learning curves (refer to chapter 7).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Scale Differences and Unit Costs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Considerable differences in output scale between the USA and EU member states impact unit costs.</li>
<li>Efficient production crucial as nations reduce defence spending and extend production programs to maintain domestic defence industrial base.</li>
<li>Attention given in the USA to cost implications of stretching-out production and evaluating if defence plants are “too large.”</li>
<li>Evidence on minimum and maximum economic annual production rates for combat aircraft, missiles, and land equipment in the USA.</li>
<li>Decreasing production rates by 50% could increase real unit costs by 7-50%, while a 50% increase could reduce unit costs by 3-18% (CBO 1987).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Efficiency Savings and Excess Capacity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nations reducing defence spending likely to examine cost implications of current scale and excess capacity in domestic defence plants.</li>
<li>Widely held view in the defence community that weapons production occurs in plants too large relative to outputs produced.</li>
<li>US evidence suggests inefficient production, with excess capacity and steeply declining short-run average cost curves indicating large plants.</li>
<li>Rogerson (1991a and b) highlights the potential for more cost-effective production in smaller-scale plants.</li>

<h1>2.5 The new economics of defense procurement and contracting</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theoretical Developments in Defence Contracting (Since 1964):</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>Buyer-seller relationship treated in a principal-agent framework.
<ul>
<li>Defence ministry as the principal (buyer and regulator).</li>
<li>Prime contractor as the agent (supplier and regulated firm).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transaction costs and contract theory.
<ul>
<li>Transactions involve costs due to bounded rationality and opportunism.</li>
<li>Contracts are often incompletely specified (Williamson, 1986).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Information asymmetries between the buyer and contractor.
<ul>
<li>Adverse selection, moral hazard, and risk-sharing in uncertain procurement situations (Cummins, 1977).</li>
<li>Game theory used to analyse strategic behaviour by both purchaser and contractors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Recognition that defence contractors may not always be profit maximizers.
<ul>
<li>Especially in imperfect and regulated markets (Williamson, 1986).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Efficient outcomes don’t necessarily require a large number of firms (contestability over industry structure).
<ul>
<li>Threat of rivalry (Baumol, 1982).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Public choice analysis and economic models of regulation offer insights into procurement policy (Cowen and Lee, 1992; Leitzel 1992; Lichtenberg, 1989).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Survey and Implications:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The following sections will explore these theoretical developments.</li>
<li>Implications for understanding defence contracting problems and contributions to policy formulation.</li>

<section id="game-theory-and-procurement" class="level1">
<h1>2.6 Game theory and procurement</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorporation of Games in Analysis (Chapters 2-4):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Games play a prominent role in the analysis.</li>
<li>Games involve two or more agents (players) determining payoffs or outcomes.</li>
<li>Non-cooperative games characterized by players, strategies, and outcomes.</li>
<li>Nash equilibrium used for simultaneous determination of defence levels, influencing demand curves (chapters 2-3).</li>
<li>Chapter 4 introduces interdependent defence level choices in static and dynamic game representations.</li>
<li>Arms races occur when one nation’s arming induces the other to follow suit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Agents in Defence Procurement Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Three relevant agents: government (e.g., Congress), military (DoD, MoD), and the firm.</li>
<li>Military often referred to as the consumer; the firm as the producer or supplier.</li>
<li>Research often focuses on interactions between two agents while suppressing the third.</li>
<li>Formulations emphasize interactions between Congress and military, Congress and the firm, or military and the firm.</li>
<li>Game analyses emphasize sequential nature or information structure, or both.</li>
<li>Sequential games often depicted as two-period games where one player decides a choice variable in anticipation of the other player’s optimizing choice in the second period.</li>
<li>Solving the game backward involves agents anticipating each other’s reactions to their behaviour.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Asymmetric Information in Procurement:</strong> - Relevant when one player is informed, and the other is not about a random variable. - Applies to principal-agent problems where the agent knows its own effort, but the principal cannot observe effort. - Ex-post cost (<span class="math inline">\(c_j\)</span>) consists of three components: 1. Agent’s expected cost of the project (<span class="math inline">\(c_i^*\)</span>). 2. Additive random variable (<span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>). 3. Cost-reducing effort (<span class="math inline">\(e_i\)</span>). - Equation: <span class="math inline">\(c_i=c_i^*+\psi-e_i\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitoring Ex-Post Cost:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The contractor (principal) can monitor ex-post cost, but component values are only known to the agent.</li>
<li>High ex-post cost may result from low effort, a bad draw of the random factor, or both.</li>
<li>Principal unable to determine whether nature or the agent causes cost overruns.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Incentive Scheme or Contract Design:</strong>
<ul>
<li>To motivate the agent, the principal must design an incentive scheme or contract.</li>
<li>The scheme should make expending high effort a dominant strategy, rewarding the agent with higher payoffs regardless of the state of nature.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bidding for Defence Procurement Contracts (McAfee and McMillan, 1986a, 1986b):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Examined in a principal-agent framework with n potential agents.</li>
<li>If agents are risk averse and the principal is risk neutral, the optimal incentive-compatible contract is usually not cost-plus but an incentive contract with shared risks.</li>
<li>Incentive contract details:
<ul>
<li>Agent receives a fixed price (bid price) and a proportion of the cost overrun.</li>
<li>Motivates the agent to keep costs down post-contract.</li>
<li>Agent adjusts bid during competition to balance cost overrun sharing.</li>
<li>Optimal contract fixes risk-sharing proportion for equilibrium.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Three-step problem-solving approach:
<ol type="1">
<li>Ascertain the agent’s effort choice for a given sharing proportion and bid to maximize expected utility of profit.</li>
<li>Determine the agent’s optimal bid for each sharing proportion, constrained by the effort choices from step one.</li>
<li>Principal chooses the sharing proportion to minimize expected cost, considering the agent’s optimizing bid and effort choices.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Non-cooperative game involving strategic interactions between military (contractor) and the firm (the agent).</li>
<li>Principal moves first, fixing the contract parameter; the agent then decides bid and effort choice if successful.</li>
<li>Backwards game solving, finding the solution in reverse order.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sequential Game Representations of Procurement Process (William Rogerson, 1990, 1991b):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Two sequential game representations presented for the procurement process.</li>
<li>Asymmetric goals: Military maximizes military value, Congress maximizes net (of cost) military value.</li>
<li>Rogerson (1990) representation:
<ul>
<li>Military chooses quality or sophistication of a weapon system.</li>
<li>Congress chooses output level, considering military’s quality choice.</li>
<li>Organizational selling results in a greater-than-first-best level for quality.</li>
<li>Quantity level depends on substitutability of quality and quantity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rogerson’s (1991a) game analysis:
<ul>
<li>Focus on weapons procurement with decisions on plant scale and output levels.</li>
<li>Military and Congress are players.</li>
<li>Equilibrium shows plant scale and output are too high, leading to higher per-unit cost.</li>
<li>Military better informed about technical design decisions, Congress delegates scale decision to military.</li>
<li>Military induces Congress to choose a larger output level by selecting a larger plant scale.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mathematical representations and assumptions:
<ul>
<li>First-best problem and second-best scale minimizes cost for a given output level.</li>
<li>Equations and conditions defining first-best and second-best solutions.</li>
<li>Equilibrium analysis involving the military choosing scale to maximize military value and Congress choosing output.</li>
<li>Equilibrium results in greater-than-first-best scale and output.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Ensure private firms fulfill defense contracts at reasonable cost, timely manner, and with suitable quality</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strategies (Burnett and Kovacic, 1989; Laffont and Tirole, 1993; Rob, 1986):

<li>Regulatory arrangements for cost disclosure and profit control</li>
<li>Use of competition at various project life cycle stages</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>New Economics of Defense Contracting:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Starts from Distinctive Features of Defense Market:
<ul>
<li>Dominance of a single large customer in the domestic market</li>
<li>High uncertainty due to rapidly changing, high technology</li>
<li>Information gaps and asymmetries</li>
<li>Long-term contractual relationships (design, development, production, in-service support)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges and Considerations in Defense Contracts:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Uncertainty:
<ul>
<li>About buyer requirements, cost, and performance</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Information Gaps:
<ul>
<li>Accentuated by differences in information available to buyers and sellers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Long-term Contracts:
<ul>
<li>Inevitably incomplete due to impossibility of anticipating all future contingencies</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Specific Investments:
<ul>
<li>Suppliers invest in human and physical capital, limiting alternatives for buyers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ex Post Opportunism:
<ul>
<li>Occurs on both sides of the buyer-seller relationship</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tradeoff:
<ul>
<li>Finding optimal balance between flexibility and prevention of opportunism</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Contracts and Incentives:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Incentives to bid low for development contracts and earn monopoly rents on production work</li>
<li>Model suggests that raising profit policy mark-up can reduce expected contractor profit and government expenditure</li>
<li>Emphasis on competitive initial contracts with subsequent profit regulation</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Industry Characteristics:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Monopoly or oligopoly on the supply side for high technology projects</li>
<li>Multi-product firms with product cost measurement challenges</li>
<li>Industry regulation on cost estimating, accountancy practices, and profitability</li>
<li>Regulatory requirements to prevent dishonesty and shirking by firms</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Distinctive Features Impacting Contractual Relationships:</strong>

<li>Methodological challenges in comparing performance on actual projects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Context of Current Policy Developments
<ul>
<li>Future defence market likely to have fewer new projects and smaller production orders.</li>
<li>Conflicting pressures to support “key” firms and open up defence equipment markets to foreign competition.</li>

<ul>
<li>Characteristics of Defence Markets
<ul>
<li>Defence markets differ from perfectly competitive models.</li>
<li>Often characterized by a single buyer, a few large suppliers, non-profit-maximizing firms, uncertainty, imperfect information, and barriers to entry/exit.</li>
<li>“Opening-up” the market to foreign firms can increase the number of potential suppliers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Economic Case for Competition
<ul>
<li>Standard economic case: competition spurs efficiency, alters attitudes, and lowers prices.</li>
<li>Attitudes toward competition have evolved over time.</li>
<li>In the 1970s, US initially viewed competition less favorably, but policies changed in favor of competition.</li>
<li>Legislative acts in the USA and similar trends in the UK promoted more competitive procurement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Principles of Competition in Project Life Cycle
<ul>
<li><p>Classification system for competition at different stages in a project’s life cycle (Table 5.2).</p></li>
<li><p>Competition can be introduced at the design, development, production, in-service support, and disposal stages.</p></li>
<li><p>Potential for domestic or international competition.</p></li>
<li><p>Various forms of competition, including winner-takes-all, dual sourcing, and storing options.</p></li>
<li><p>Trade-offs between benefits (incentives to reduce costs, increase quality) and costs (set-up costs, technology transfer, failure to exploit learning economies).</p>
<pre><code>           Competition possible at                                      | Type of competition &lt;br&gt; Non-price |      Risks - uncertainty      |</code></pre>
<p>|:———————-:|:———————-:|:———————-:| | 1 Design stage | Non-price | Maximum | | 2 Development stage - prototype | Non-price; <br> budget limit | Great to prototype <br> stage | | 3 Production stage <br> all production work <br> (winner takes all) <br> batches (dual sourcing) | Price <br> Price | Little-none | | 4 In-service support, repairs, <br> servicing, mid-life up-dates | Price | Some-none | | 5 Disposal | Price | None to great <br> (nuclear) |</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Analysis of Costs and Benefits

<li><strong>Research and Development (R&amp;D) Impact on Competition Policy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Equipment procurement is a multi-stage process (design, development, initial production, full production).</li>
<li>Sole source procurement leads to vigorous competition in the development stage but potential monopoly profits later.</li>
<li>Competition at the initial award stage influences winning bids and long-term profits.</li>
<li>Expectation of a second source reduces aggressiveness in initial production contract bidding.</li>
<li>Initial competitive contract awards may not significantly improve weapons procurement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Competition’s Adverse Effect on Innovation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Profits/prizes on production contracts are seen as rewards for earlier innovation.</li>
<li>Rent-seeking firms invest in winning production contracts through innovative activities.</li>
<li>Competitive procurement policies (dual or second sourcing) may reduce economic profits on contracts.</li>
<li>Reduction in economic profits can potentially lead to a decrease in innovation.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="technology-transfer">Technology Transfer</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technology Transfer in Production Stage:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Competition at the production stage necessitates technology transfer.</li>
<li>Creating an alternative producer involves transferring technology from the initial developer.</li>
<li>Costs can arise from legal disputes over intellectual property rights.</li>
<li>Ensuring the second source fully understands the initial developer’s information can be challenging.</li>
<li>The original supplier may have incentives to hoard valuable information.</li>
<li>Experience with international co-production programs suggests feasible technology transfer at modest cost (Hall and Johnson, 1967).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Indirect Costs of Technology Transfer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The CICA of 1984 initially required bidders to relinquish proprietary technical data rights.</li>
<li>Private developers limiting government’s data rights faced elimination from competition.</li>
<li>Such requirements affected entry and exit, particularly for firms with high-value commercial markets.</li>
<li>CICA was modified in 1988 to prevent disadvantage for contractors relying on privately developed products.</li>
<li>Modification aimed to incentivize private industry investment in risky new technology (Brunette, 1989).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Competition at Production Stage:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Forms of competition: dual sourcing (simultaneous production from two suppliers) and second sourcing (creating a new supplier via technology transfer).</li>
<li>Initial production work by the original developer provides a unit cost advantage.</li>
<li>Setup costs for a second supplier increase the advantage of the incumbent.</li>
<li>Competitive procurement aims to limit sole source monopoly profits and reduce X-inefficiency.</li>
<li>Optimal replacement of the incumbent may occur, even with higher production costs for the new entrant (Demski et al., 1987).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Learning Curve Analysis:</strong>

<li>Learning curve used to evaluate single source vs.&nbsp;competitive procurement in production (figure 5.4).</li>
<li>Unit costs and savings analyzed based on quantity and production batches.</li>
<li>Sole source producer’s response to entry threat considered in figure 5.5.</li>

<li><strong>Evidence on Savings and Competition:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Researchers estimate savings using learning curves, with prices reflecting contractor costs.</li>
<li>US empirical literature suggests average savings due to competition range from 11% to 53%, with a median saving of 33%.</li>
<li>Dual sourcing found to be more expensive in one study, and savings realization is not always obvious.</li>
<li>Second source often wins competitions, but empirical studies on competitive savings are considered flawed (Anton and Yao, 1990).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Performance Indicators in Procurement:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Evidence on fixed-price contracts, cost escalation, and profitability.</li>
<li>Total package procurement in the 1960s (e.g., Lockheed C-5A, Grumman F-14) led to underestimation of costs, massive overruns, and losses.</li>
<li>Fixed-price contracts with technological uncertainties may result in disputes and difficulties in enforcement.</li>
<li>Contract and contractor performance assessed by cost control, delivery schedules, and equipment performance.</li>
<li>Impact of 1970s Packard Initiatives, hardware competition, and competitive programs on performance and cost growth.</li>
<li>Profitability as an indicator of contractor performance and its relationship with competition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Comparative Studies and Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Price reduction curve (figure 5.6) predicts lower prices with competition, influenced by a shift effect and a rotation effect.</li>
<li>Greer and Liao suggest that competition, especially dual sourcing, results in net savings when industry capacity utilization is below 80 percent.</li>
<li>Empirical studies on the impact of the UK’s competitive procurement policy: claims of efficiency improvement, export performance, and a wider supplier base.</li>
<li>Studies also highlight concerns about reduced market concentration, increased competition, exits from the industry, bidding costs, decision delays, and reluctance to invest in private venture R &amp; D.</li>

<h1>2.10 Conclusion: the results of competition</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Competition Policy Implementation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Legislative support for US competition policy.</li>
<li>Procurement officials have discretion in applying competition and allowing exceptions (Burnett and Kovacic, 1989).</li>
<li>Possibility of anti-competitive behavior by buyers, especially in the military-industrial-political complex.</li>
<li>Public choice analysis suggests opposition from interest groups, contractors, and procurement agencies preferring non-competitive relationships.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Limitations and Unexpected Outcomes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Simplified economic models of competition by policymakers can lead to unexpected and undesirable results.</li>
<li>Examples of limitations:
<ul>
<li>Second sourcing for competition might increase overall program costs by 40% compared to sole sourcing.</li>
<li>Contract winners expect lower future profits, leading to reduced investment in R &amp; D.</li>
<li>Teaming arrangements can result in anti-competitive behavior such as collusion and cartels.</li>
<li>Potential conflicts between competition policy and regulatory policy.</li>
<li>Arguments that US DoD procurement resembles actions of an industry-captured regulator (Leitzel, 1992).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Challenges and Modifications in Economic Models:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Agents in the political marketplace implement economic models of competition.</li>
<li>Recent developments in game theory, strategic behavior, transaction costs, contestability, and Austrian economics have led to substantial modifications in simplified interpretations of economic models.</li>
