to the Public Accounts Committee on Monday 22 January 2024. Today, we are looking at the <br> defence equipment plan, which is something that the Ministry of Defence publishes every year. It sets <br> out the spending and the capability requirements of the Ministry of Defence over the next decade that <br> our Armed Forces need to operate. This latest plan is £16.9 billion over budget over that 10-year <br> period. That is the largest deficit since the MoD first published the plan. It is a big difference <br> from last year's plan, with costs having risen by nearly £66 billion.<br>\",\"For a lot of us, it feels a bit like groundhog day as we come back and look at this challenge every <br> year. It is quite right that we look at it over a 10-year period, but it is, nevertheless, a somewhat <br> depressing picture. Some of the reasons for that, which we will go into, are around inflation and <br> other costs, but we need to get to the bottom of what is happening and how the Ministry of Defence <br> will work to bridge that gap.<br>\",\"I am delighted to welcome our witnesses. We have David Williams, Permanent Secretary at the Ministry <br> of Defence; Tom Wipperman, director of strategic finance and investment approvals at the Ministry <br> of Defence; Andy Start, chief executive of defence equipment and support, often referred to as DE&S; <br> and Lieutenant General Robert Magowan, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff, who is responsible for <br> financial and military capability. A very warm welcome to you all.<br>\",\"Before we go into our main session, we have just a couple of quick questions about other matters that <br> might affect defence.<br>\",\"Good afternoon, everyone. Mr Williams, I am going to ask a question about the Port Talbot steel <br> closures and what assessment you have made of the possible impact that this will have on defence <br> manufacturing going forward.<br>\",\"I have not yet reviewed any impact from the recent announcement. We do, however, take the security <br> and sustainability of our supply chain seriously, including access to raw materials. As the Committee <br> knows, the Department intervened just over a year ago to support Sheffield Forgemasters, so it is <br> an area in which we are interested. To the extent that there are wider Government conversations on a <br> response to the announcement, I would expect the Ministry of Defence to be engaged as an interested <br> party, but I have not been involved in that.<br>\",\"Are there any projects or specific programmes that are likely to be affected? What will happen with <br> the shortfall of materials that is going to be needed? What are the possible options available to us <br> with the closure of Port Talbot steelworks?<br>\",\"Mr Start may want to come in on this. The supply of steel is, in the first instance, a matter for <br> our prime contractors who are producing equipment for us. I have not had any specific impacts from the <br> Tata announcement flagged to me yet, but I am happy to take that away and write to the Committee, <br> if that would be helpful.<br>\",\"That would be great. Tata Steel UK currently provides high-tech steel to UK defence for engine and <br> gearbox components on fixed-wing and rotary aircraft, and for hatch covers on armoured personnel <br> carriers and nuclear submarines, so it would be great if we could get the specifics on those.<br>\",\"I am happy to follow up on that.<br>\",\"Good afternoon. That is a smart tie, Mr Start. Mr Williams, on Saturday, Larisa Brown, the excellent <br> defence editor of The Times, had a front-page splash entitled, \\\"Army numbers to drop below 70,000 <br> 'in two years'\\\". This is germane to an examination of the equipment plan, because, as you well know, <br> unless you have suitably qualified and experienced personnel---SQEP, as the military calls them---to <br> maintain your kit and keep it working, you can spend all the money that you want on very expensive <br> equipment, and some of it in this plan is incredibly expensive, but, if you cannot maintain it, it <br> is no good to anybody. It could be a ship left on the harbour wall, a tank in the tank park, or an <br> aircraft that is a hangar queen. What are you doing to stop the absolute haemorrhaging of people leaving <br> the Armed Forces?<br>\",\"The projection in that article is one from recent trends rather than our plan. It is an issue that <br> all three services and the Department are taking seriously. Our approach is a combination of a range <br> of short-term measures to increase attraction and retention. Some of that involves proposals around <br> financial incentives, for example, as well as longer-term initiatives, including recommendations from <br> the Haythornthwaite review from last summer about how we think about patterns of service and zigzag <br> careers, and make sure that we are accessing the skills that we need.<br>\",\"When you say \\\"zigzag careers\\\", do you mean people coming in and out?<br>\",\"People coming in and out of service, yes.<br>\",\"Mr Williams, I am sorry to cut across you, but, as you are well aware, there is never enough time in <br> these sessions, so apologies for keeping this tightly focused. At the moment, across all three <br> services, people are leaving the Armed Forces at a ratio of three people leaving for every one who joins. <br> I deliberately use the analogy of the National Health Service, where my wife works, but that is <br> the equivalent of the patient bleeding out on the operating table. You cannot maintain that for long. <br> If you do, you will have operational failure, because you will not have enough skilled personnel to <br> make it work. What you have said is all very well, but I and the Committee detect no sense of urgency. <br> They are leaving at a rate that you cannot sustain. What are you doing to stop the bleed?<br>\",\"I do not immediately recognise the one-to-three ratio.<br>\",\"That came directly from the fifth floor, privately.<br>\",\"On our most recent published statistics---and I accept that those are from the---<br>\",\"General Magowan is busily looking through his paperwork. We will come to you in a moment.<br>\",\"You are right that outflow is higher than inflow. On any numbers, that is the situation. I can assure <br> the Committee that it is being taken very seriously. There is lots of ministerial interest in how <br> the services are addressing this issue. It is probably the number one risk that we are routinely <br> engaging with in senior management fora in the Department. There is a set of individual initiatives that <br> each service is taking, as well as us, in thinking through those broader pay, attraction and <br> retention measures.<br>\",\"For brevity, I will have one more go and then hand back. The Army is one example, but it is not just <br> the Army. According to policy, it is going to reduce to 72,500 within the next couple of years. <br> According to this article, it will be at 70,000 in two years. If you extrapolate the trend at which they <br> are leaving, David, by the end of 2026, it will be at 68,000. If you extrapolate the line forward <br> to a decade's time, it will be at 52,000, meaning that, as a graphic example, you could fit the entire <br> regular British army in the Etihad stadium. Some of them are Man U supporters who will not like <br> that. This really is a crisis. Is the Secretary of State going to make an oral statement to Parliament <br> to flesh out what he is doing to stop the bleeding?<br>\",\"Just to be precise, we are aiming for 73,000. There is an additional 500 from the National Cyber Force.<br>\",\"At the rate at which they are leaving, that is an academic point.<br>\",\"I get that. The numbers that you set out for where the trained strength of the Army would be by those <br> dates is not our plan. I acknowledge that our current plan is not working in the way that we want. <br> I am happy to pass your request about a statement back to Ministers. All I would say is that---and <br> I am trying to think whether I have said this to this Committee before or to your sister Defence <br> Select Committee---if I think about the risks that keep me awake in defence, the number one risk to <br> delivering our programme is access now and over time to the right number of people in and not in uniform, <br> with the skills that we need.<br>\",\"In fairness, your Secretary of State is an intelligent man. He is now well aware of the problem. The <br> question is whether he could come to Parliament and tell us what he is going to do about it. You <br> have the point. I will leave it there.<br>\",\"General Magowan, you were looking for the figures there, and I wondered whether you had any update.<br>\",\"Our figures are five to eight rather than one to three, but that is by the bye. We accept the problem. <br> As the Permanent Secretary has said, probably one of the top three of those critical problems is <br> military capability, and people are part of that. We are not being complacent at all and we have the <br> measures in place that the Permanent Secretary has just mentioned.<br>\",\"The only thing that I would add is that trends change, and can do so quite quickly, particularly <br> around strategic events, which can be either a positive or a negative for recruiting, so I will leave <br> it at that. Trends change in somebody's head tomorrow morning, so we can extrapolate, but we need to <br> be ready for changes.<br>\",\"This is something that we look at in other sessions as well, as does our sister Committee. We want <br> to look at the equipment plan and the affordability of it, and the simple question, Mr Williams, is <br> this. After all this time that I and this Committee have been looking at it, we have a gap, which has <br> significantly deteriorated since last year. Why?<br>\",\"As you set out, Chair, the excess on our current assumptions over budget over the 10-year period is <br> just under £17 billion. Just to put that in context, that is around a 6% overall excess on a baseline <br> budget assumption of just under £290 billion. There are two principal drivers of that change. One <br> is the impact of adverse economic conditions, particularly the impact of extraordinary inflation, <br> which has added around £11 billion to the cost of the programme as we previously envisaged that to be. <br> Together with movement on foreign exchange rates of a couple of billion pounds, that is the bulk of <br> the net increase.<br>\",\"We have also taken a decision linked to the context of the dangerous world in which we find ourselves, <br> consistent with the integrated review and with the defence command paper, to seriously de-risk <br> the nuclear enterprise in defence by ensuring that it is fully funded and de-risked, and so there has <br> been a substantial increase in the cost of the nuclear enterprise over that period as well.<br>\",\"As we may come on to, I would describe this equipment plan as, effectively, a work in progress. We <br> drew a line under it at the end of March 2023. There is more to be done on ensuring not only that the <br> programme is affordable but that there is clarity on assumptions around budget, around the costs <br> and around the content of the programme.<br>\",\"At the moment, the spending review is scheduled for November of this year, but we will come to that <br> later, because there are a number of uncertainties around that. You have this shortfall of nearly <br> £17 billion. As you say, some of those pressures such as inflation and forex are difficult to control, <br> but you are going to have to manage that shortfall nevertheless, so it is a balance between capability <br> or efficiencies. How are you going to approach that? We stress that it is over a 10-year period, <br> so there is front-loading and back-loading that you can do, but we have seen problems before when <br> you have just moved issues to the right. Can you assure us that you are not going to do that, and what <br> are you going to do to try to shrink the gap?<br>\",\"Let me say this in as reassuring a way as I can. One of the uncertainties that we are dealing with <br> is the timing of the Government's commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. On Monday <br> last week, the Prime Minister said in the House that the timing and trajectory would be a matter for <br> the next spending review. We are keen not to cut, defer or de-scope capability programmes unnecessarily <br> in advance of clarity around that budget. That is one of the reasons why, in the material that <br> we set out to the Committee, we talk about an upside and downside budget scenario.<br>\",\"As inflation changes, the forward costs over a 10-year programme will change as well. Inflation is <br> coming down, so some of the assumptions about the costs of the programme in the later years will <br> reduce.<br>\",\"You still have the increase that you have had in recent years.<br>\",\"We still have the increase that we have had in recent years, and we are currently in the middle of <br> a force design process, looking at the capabilities that we want to commit to. Some of those will be <br> from the programme of record that we already have, as set out in this document, but we also want to <br> reflect some of the new challenges and the learning set out in our defence command paper last summer, <br> partly through lessons from Ukraine and partly around the pace of technological change.<br>\",\"We are going to touch on capabilities in more detail in a moment. You have the gap in the equipment <br> plan. You are saying you are going to wait until the spending review before making decisions about <br> the 2.5%. Whether or not that happens, you are waiting. In the meantime, there are no real plans to <br> cut projects and, if there are any that are not really going to deliver, they are going to keep costing <br> money. Even if everything else is benign---you get an increase in defence spending, inflation <br> decreases and a few other things work in your favour---there will still be a shortfall. Is there any <br> realistic work going on about cutting or reducing a programme?<br>\",\"There is work underway right now, which is really looking at this problem in two parts. First, what <br> are we going to do for the financial year 2024-25, maybe into 2025-26, and, secondly, what are our <br> capability priorities across the 10-year period overall? Those are two somewhat different questions. <br> It may well be that we need to take measures against existing programmes to manage through the first <br> couple of years of that pressure. We have more choice when it comes to the decisions that we make <br> over the 10-year period in terms of contractual commitment, although it starts higher and then tails <br> off. Over the 10-year period, we are currently only about 25% on contract, so there is quite a lot <br> of choice in the later years of the 10-year planning horizon about where we want to invest.<br>\",\"So you are deferring the choices about making hard decisions.<br>\",\"We are deferring some choices where there are no-regrets decisions. For example, one of the key <br> lessons from Ukraine is that we need to invest more in our munitions stockpiles. We will get on with that <br> in advance of the next spending review. We are doing that already and, no doubt, we can talk a bit <br> about that in this session.<br>\",\"The point is about not stopping things unnecessarily over the next 12 to 18 months, if it turns out <br> that we are going to have funding headroom for it. What that means is quite an important focus on <br> commitment control. As we are going through the approvals and putting new programmes on to contract, <br> there is then a decision about being confident that we want those in the forward programme, come what <br> may, given the budgetary and costing scenarios that we face. If not, we then take a decision on a <br> case-by-case basis about whether it makes most sense to defer that programme.<br>\",\"We are going to get into a long answer here. There are lots of words, but we are going to drill down <br> on some of the capability issues a little later. A colleague will be picking up on those. One of <br> the things about this report is that, when it came out, the Department's public statement did not sound <br> like it agreed with the National Audit Office's take on this, which is well worked up. Can you just <br> be clear that it is an agreed report?<br>\",\"It is an agreed report, and it is based on data that we shared with the National Audit Office. We <br> worked closely with it on the production of the report. The distinction---and it is not a criticism of <br> the NAO work but almost having set it an impossible task---is that we did not publish our own <br> equipment plan this year, because of the uncertainty of how we would deal with inflation and the opportunity <br> to think about new capabilities that we want in light of the defence command plan. That is why <br> I described it as a work in progress. There are a set of issues that we still need to work through.<br>\",\"The NAO analysis is not very different to the approach taken every year. It is a view based on a set <br> of data, which, for us, is still interim. That is really all that I mean. There is more to come.<br>\",\"I am going to drill down a little further on the Chair's questioning. You are holding everything in <br> this 10-year defence plan, knowing that it is unaffordable. Is this a deliberate ploy to put pressure <br> on the Treasury to give you that 2.5% more quickly than it would otherwise wish to?<br>\",\"No, not directly. The point is simply that, if you are looking to plan with a degree of precision <br> over a 10-year period, it is helpful to know what your budget is. I have certainty about my budget only <br> for the next 15 months before we are into the next spending review, so it is based on a set of <br> assumptions.<br>\",\"Was \\\"the next 15 months\\\" a slip of the tongue? The spending review is scheduled for November of this <br> year, we believe.<br>\",\"I have budget certainty until the end of March 2025.<br>\",\"Then the new spending review will kick in. Forgive me. You are right.<br>\",\"There will then be a debate for 2025-26. My point is that the Government's stated position is that, <br> as economic and fiscal circumstances allow, the defence budget is going to increase. The core assumption <br> here does not factor that in. My colleagues may correct me, but the upper scenario for our <br> defence budget assumes growth towards 2.5% from 2027 through to 2032, but that is just an assumption from <br> us.<br>\",\"The point that the Chair was trying to make is that, without prejudging whether the Chancellor is <br> going to give you that 2.5%, the content of this defence plan is unaffordable. Therefore, the responsible <br> thing to do---and, indeed, any budget holder in any other Department would be widely criticised <br> if they did not do this---would, surely, be to make a priority list and take out those items that <br> were not an absolute priority. Otherwise, you are holding items in there, spending money, planning <br> staff, working out budgets and everything else. You might then have to cancel them much later in the <br> day, which would lead to very poor value for money for some of the other matters that remained in. You <br> would get better value for money if you took out those that were not priorities, would you not?<br>\",\"First, depending on the timing of a move to 2.5% of GDP, the plan could well be affordable as currently <br> set out. That definitely does not mean that we are being complacent about managing inflationary <br> pressure where we can. We are going through that process, and General Magowan is leading the process <br> at the moment to review our priorities against not only affordability but the kinds of capability <br> lessons from Ukraine and the ambition that we set out in the defence command paper refresh last summer. <br> We are doing that and, where there is a no-regrets move to either fund or stop, my expectation is <br> that we would enact that quickly. Where it is something that makes sense to view in the round <br> alongside a spending review process, those are decisions that we will take when we get into that <br> cross-Government resource allocation event.<br>\",\"I am going to switch to you, Mr Wipperman. Good afternoon. We have limited time, so shortish answers <br> would be really helpful. I want to talk about two aspects of the plan. It says in the NAO report <br> that you are planning to move quite substantially to inflation-linked contracts because of the recent <br> spike in inflation, which is now coming down. What incentive does that give to your defence contractors <br> to keep their costs down if you do that?<br>\",\"The reason why we have moved towards that policy is that, going into this period of high inflation, <br> around 25% of our contracts were firm price, and so the suppliers were taking the inflation risk. As <br> we have moved into very high levels of inflation and very volatile movements in inflation, the cost <br> to us of trying to put that risk on to suppliers has been too great. The value-for-money judgment <br> is that we get better value for money by linking to the appropriate indices---and I am happy to talk <br> about indices in a second---that mean that suppliers are not fully exposed to that risk and that we <br> are doing some risk sharing. Which indices we might use for any particular contract will depend on <br> the nature of what we are buying and the materials that go towards a product.<br>\",\"One of my colleagues is going to ask about that. On the specific issue of contracts, you did not <br> answer the second bit of my question about what incentive there is on your suppliers to keep their costs <br> down, if you give them a full inflation-linked contract. It puts me in mind---and I am old enough <br> to remember this---of the old cost‑plus contracts, where the MoD was well and truly ripped off by <br> its suppliers because they knew that they could immediately pass every single increase in costs back <br> to the taxpayer.<br>\",\"Mr Start may want to comment on the details of the contracts, because he would be closer than I, but <br> the indices that we would use will set out a set of costs and be independent of any particular <br> behaviours. The indices are to do with market prices and the way that things are moving. Linking it to <br> the contract, whether it is CPI, clothing and textile indices, or RPI, will be an escalator within <br> the contract that we would have agreed.<br>\",\"Surely, it is in all of our interests to try to keep inflation down. One way to do that is to put <br> pressure on your suppliers, and one way to do that is by an incentivised contract rather than full <br> inflation-linked contract.<br>\",\"If I may, there is a value trade-off to be had around inflation volatility. If the inflation volatility <br> is very high---<br>\",\"It has peaked and is coming down.<br>\",\"It is, but it is still really quite volatile. At this point, that volatility means that, at the <br> moment, on balance, we are better off using indices rather than fixed prices. Once it is stabilised, we <br> will probably wish to go back to fixed prices. It depends on the nature of the individual contract <br> as to the level of incentive to the supplier within the contract. If you are on a target cost incentive <br> fee style contract, there becomes a strong incentive for the contractor to try to keep the cost <br> down. If you are on a more straightforward single-source contract, there is less incentive within the <br> contract.<br>\",\"Conversely, industry knows that the more it spends on a particular contract, the less there is to <br> spend on other things. Its supply chain is not where it wants to spend the money. It wants to spend <br> the money on generating more profit. Driving costs down and making the products that it has more <br> exportable is more attractive, so there is an export incentive, although I would like that incentive to <br> be stronger. That is the other dynamic that sits in this frame. It is not perfect, and every dynamic <br> has a trade-off, but, at the moment, it is very clear to us that, if we try to cost in inflation with <br> the level of volatility, we are just not getting good-value-for-money offers back.<br>\",\"General, good afternoon. Can I come to you, please, on a completely different aspect? This is on how <br> your top-level budget holders approach their budgets. Some approach it on a completely different <br> basis to others. For example, the RAF and the Navy have unaffordable plans, because they include full <br> predictive costs for the capabilities that Government expect them to deliver, while others, such as <br> the Army and the strategic programmes directorate, have developed affordable plans by accepting <br> greater risks that their capabilities will not meet Government's objectives. Does that make any sense? <br> Surely, they should all do their budgets on the same basis. Otherwise, you cannot compare apples with <br> apples. You are comparing apples with pears.<br>\",\"On the financial machinery, I will hand to Mr Wipperman. From the perspective of capability and the <br> risk that we carry, it does not make any difference to me, because I can see what capabilities we <br> need in each domain or across domains---multidomain, as we say---and whether that is costed in the <br> programme. I compare that against the risk register that I hold, so how they report it and whether it <br> is within or without their costed programme is not going to deflect me from understanding where the <br> operational risk is. The machinery of the process is more in Mr Wipperman's space.<br>\",\"I probably asked the question to the wrong person. I apologise.<br>\",\"To build on what the general said, the first thing that we would really want to be clear on is that <br> we are not saying to TLBs that they can go off and do whatever they want in terms of the way they <br> build up their budgets and plan. Through the planning round, we set them a clear set of instructions <br> about what they need to do. We set them clear parameters---for example, the inflation, forex or pay <br> rates that they need to use. They have to build that within their equipment plan and the rest of their <br> budget to make sure that there is consistency.<br>\",\"Where we see a difference is between the TLBs that put the cost of some projects that are within <br> policy or within ambition in their plan and those that do not. Going back to what the Permanent Secretary <br> said a short while ago, the plan represents a snapshot of a period in time and the capabilities <br> that the Army knows it needs to develop came out through the DCPR work, which was undertaken after <br> this plan closed on 31 March. Through the early part of this financial year, as we finalise the DCPR, <br> we are now working through how we bring some of those capabilities and choices into the plan and the <br> sorts of trade-offs that we might need to make elsewhere.<br>\",\"Does it really? If they are doing it on a different basis, some are including the risks and some are <br> not. How can that be fair? If I were CDS, I would be pretty miffed that others were doing it on a <br> different basis to me and I would say, \\\"If they are doing it on a different basis, I am going to do <br> it on a different basis\\\".<br>\",\"As the general said, we see clearly in their plans, which come back to us, the balance of financial <br> and capability risk that they take. They are able to make different judgments within their own budgets <br> and plans of the extent to which they want to balance those. We do not just accept what comes back <br> to us. We are working closely with the general's teams to say, \\\"Are we comfortable that that balance <br> of risk between each TLB is correct?\\\" In some places, we might say that we want them to take less <br> capability risk. In others, we might want them to take financial risk. It depends on the nature of <br> the suppliers and of the contracts that they run, and whether they have flexibility.<br>\",\"Could you give a precise example of each of the scenarios---one where there is more capability risk <br> and one where there is more financial risk? We have really puzzled over why this was. When I first <br> saw this last autumn, I could not understand it, and I still do not.<br>\",\"I will leave the machinery to Mr Wipperman. To your point, Chair, about examples, one would be between <br> the Navy and the Army. There are elements in the plan---and we can go through those---with regard <br> to the shipbuilding pipeline into the 2030s that are not funded and so are a pressure within the <br> Navy. As I have discussed at various Committees, the so-called four plus one, which we can go into, <br> sits above the line in the Army as something that is not funded, but it is outside their EP.<br>\",\"When I look at that, there is no advantage to the Navy or the Army as to whether it is above or below <br> the line. I know that we have to commit more to our shipbuilding pipeline into the 2030s, and we <br> know that we have to treat some of these operational risks that we are learning from Ukraine and the <br> so-called four plus one in the Army. The deliberation of where we are going to make decisions and <br> where we are going to hold operational risk is not manifest in terms of the decisions that we make.<br>\",\"For me, it is partly a function of timing. As Mr Wipperman said, quite a lot of the conversations <br> about the Army increases were discussions that we worked through after we drew a line under this <br> equipment plan in the context of our offering into the new NATO force model---what our contribution was <br> going to be to the strategic reserve, rapid reaction forces, regional plans and so on. There is a <br> debate now to be had about whether the Army is funding them from within its existing programme or whether <br> that will be money allocated to it by us.<br>\",\"The challenge here is partly that it is about a set of risk judgments as to where you hold the balance <br> of capability, financial and, indeed, delivery risk in a delegated system. That is something that <br> we are looking at as part of our review of procurement and of the operating model. It is partly <br> about the extent to which, in that delegated model, frontline commands in particular have the authority <br> to make changes, or whether they need to refer back to us through processes that General Rob runs.<br>\",\"I have absolutely no problem in accepting the recommendation from the NAO that we should try to make <br> this more consistent. Although we can see the line, it is an additional challenge for us, which, <br> all things being equal, I would rather we did not have, and it does make it quite difficult for you to <br> hold us to account.<br>\",\"You have anticipated my next question. As professionals, you may well understand why it is done on <br> a different basis, but, in terms of transparency to the general public, surely it ought to be done on <br> a consistent basis.<br>\",\"It would clearly make our equipment plan easier to interpret. As we think about how we reshape <br> publication of equipment plan data for the future, views not only from the NAO but from this Committee <br> will be most welcome. There is a question for us, notwithstanding where, formally, the numbers come <br> out at the end of a planning round, as to whether we want to present it on a standardised basis, even <br> if we would have to think about how we work our internal data with the NAO.<br>\",\"That is long answer but you have given us a good hint for a recommendation.<br>\",\"I think it is a yes.<br>\",\"It is just worth pointing out that paragraph 1.12 on page 19 in the NAO report highlights the Army's <br> approach. This why I was and still am puzzled, and I am heartened that you are saying that it would <br> be good to get the same baseline. If that approach was taken, the estimate is that it would be around <br> £12 billion more to fully provide the capabilities, which is potentially an added shortfall.<br>\",\"Some of that includes investment in ammunition stocks, for which we have said in the DCP that we will <br> allocate another £2.5 billion. It is not all for the Army, but quite a lot of it will go in that <br> direction. Some of it will be programmes that the Army will want to fund by prioritising new investment <br> over old.<br>\",\"To be fair, ammunitions are to be delivered in the short term.<br>\",\"We want to get to the situation of an always-on production line on munitions, so that we can surge <br> when we need to.<br>\",\"My point is that it is quicker to deliver munitions than a new aircraft carrier.<br>\",\"Not necessarily. The whole point of munitions is not what you just said, Chair, if I may say. It is <br> about a long-term commitment to industry. We are learning, through operational lessons and not just <br> from Ukraine, that we need a stronger industrial base. Some, but not all, of those areas will need <br> some time to get to a level of production that is suitable for the ability to deter state-on-state <br> conflict.<br>\",\"So we are not talking about just a few years; we are talking about a decade.<br>\",\"In some cases, we can go quite quickly. Mr Start is much more of an expert than I am in facing <br> industry. For others, it is going to take a period of time, but that is the business that we are in. We <br> are in long-term commitment, long-term resilience and long-term deterrence.<br>\",\"We are beginning to get flesh on the bones of the picture.<br>\",\"Mr Williams, I have a general question that is very germane to this. The Secretary of State recently <br> gave evidence to the Defence Committee, where he presaged a major announcement within the next few <br> months on big changes to the way that we procure military equipment. As you know, you and the Defence <br> Committee have had certain discussions on this. Can you give us a date for when that announcement <br> is likely to be made? Can you promise us that it will be made to Parliament first and that we will <br> not read about it on the newswires, not least because the Speaker is at about the limits of his <br> tolerance on this? When can we expect this major new announcement about procurement reform? If you cannot <br> answer that, maybe Mr Start can.<br>\",\"There is always a set of grid and parliamentary business processes to work through. As you know, <br> normally when I give the Committee dates, they turn out not to be right. We are targeting an announcement <br> before Easter.<br>\",\"We recognise that it is not entirely in your hands. We do understand that.<br>\",\"That is good, because the House rises on 26 March and is due back a little after that, but then we <br> are in April and in purdah for the elections and all the rest of it. If it is not by then, you are <br> probably talking about mid-May, realistically. We understand grid management. Can you just give us your <br> commitment---and we respect you, David---that you will do your very best, subject to those extraneous <br> factors, to have it made before we rise for the Easter recess on 26 March?<br>\",\"We are collectively being driven by the defence ministerial team for the work to be ready in that <br> kind of timeframe.<br>\",\"That is as far as we can ask you to go. That is very good. Thank you very much. Moving on to some <br> programme specifics, let us look at the Royal Navy. There have been many press reports that Type 23 <br> frigates HMS Westminster and HMS Argyll, which have gone into refit, will not come back out, which <br> would take us down to 15 available frigates and destroyers as opposed to the current number of 17 and <br> what was, for very many years, a number of 19. Will Westminster and Argyll come back into active <br> service from refit?<br>\",\"The Secretary of State has not yet decided on those two particular vessels. We are in negotiation <br> with the Navy so that we can provide the advice to the Secretary of State. He has not yet announced <br> what is going to happen to Westminster and Argyll.<br>\",\"But you cannot tell us for definite that they are coming back. It is subject to final approval, one <br> way or another, by the Secretary of State. It is, metaphorically, on his desk.<br>\",\"Yes, exactly what you have just said, Mr Francois.<br>\",\"We know what that means, so we are down to 15. For the Type 31 programme and the Venturer class, is <br> initial operating capability still late 2027?<br>\",\"Yes, 2027.<br>\",\"For the Type 26 and HMS Glasgow, initial operating capability is still October 2028.<br>\",\"That is correct.<br>\",\"So we are going to have to run the gauntlet of this gap for the best part of another three years, <br> nearly four, when, even on a good day, we may have only 15 escorts available when you knock off the <br> ones that are in refit or deep maintenance. In the Defence Committee's public session, we asked the <br> First Sea Lord, \\\"How many escorts, including those already on active service, could you put to sea to <br> fight tonight?\\\" He said eight and a half. As he is the First Sea Lord, I presume that you agree with <br> that figure.<br>\",\"I will agree. On your first point, you made an assumption about Westminster and Argyll, and we will <br> have to wait and see what the Secretary of State's decision is on those two.<br>\",\"I understand that, but what I am saying is that you have not contradicted me, so we will make that <br> the working assumption for this afternoon. That is eight and a half escorts that the Royal Navy could <br> put to sea. How on earth can we deter Vladimir Putin with eight and a half escorts, when the <br> destroyers' power packs do not work very well and the Type 23 frigates are so old that they keep failing <br> their MOT? Who are we kidding here?<br>\",\"First of all, the high watermark of 13 Type 23 and six Type 45 does not translate to 19 escorts at <br> what we call readiness level 0. You know, Mr Francois, that the system does not work like that.<br>\",\"Yes. Would that it did.<br>\",\"That is the first point. Secondly, the United Kingdom is not facing down the Russian navy by itself. <br> It is there to deter our adversaries along with an alliance called NATO. Thirdly, we accept that <br> the Type 23s are coming to the end of their life, although some of them will be in service through to <br> the 2030s, which is precisely why you have just given the dates.<br>\",\"How has this situation been allowed to develop? The Type 26 has slipped again and again. The cost of <br> that one-year extension in time to the taxpayer is nearly £250 million. How old the Type 23s are is <br> not a state secret. It is like that car that you keep putting through for an MOT and, every year, <br> it gets more expensive. Why have we allowed the Type 26 programme to slip to the point where it takes <br> 11 years to build a frigate, when some other nations can build the equivalent in three? How did that <br> happen?<br>\",\"First, we have to be careful with comparisons. I think that the example you are picking is Japan, <br> which has got down to a three-year build cycle, but we should get down to a three-year build cycle with <br> Type 31 as we come to the back end of the Type 31 build process. Type 26 is an absolutely top-end <br> capability. It is pushing the boundaries of what has been done before in order to provide us with an <br> asset that is as capable as possible to make it. That has had real technical issues in developing <br> the ship.<br>\",\"The good news on Type 26 is that we now appear to have a stable programme. They are making decent <br> progress. I am pleased to see the investment in the build hall. I was up there just before Christmas, <br> and progress on the first ship is starting to really come on. It is disappointing that it takes that <br> long, but the comparisons are not exactly like for like and, as I said, when we get to the back end <br> of the Type 31 programme, we should be at that three-to-four-year build time.<br>\",\"To save time, the Type 26 is a world beater. We have exported it to Australia and Canada. In terms <br> of the prosperity agenda, this is fantastic. The ship is so good that we are anxious to get it into <br> service sooner rather than later. That is why we are beating you up about it a bit: we do not want to <br> wait any longer than we have to for a world beating ship.<br>\",\"Let us move on to Fort Victoria. If the carrier sails, it needs a support ship to carry some of its <br> stores. The last one we have that can do that is Fort Victoria, which is nearly 30 years old. We have <br> a competition to build some new ones. That has been delayed and delayed, so they are years away. <br> If the carrier now sails without Fort Victoria, we have to beg, steal and borrow a support ship from <br> another ally. We have spent £10 billion, including the aircraft, on a \\\"sovereign\\\" carrier capability <br> that now hangs on borrowing a support ship from another nation. Why did Fort Victoria not sail? Was <br> it because she is not technically ready to put to sea, or you cannot crew her?<br>\",\"Fort Victoria is going through a scheduled maintenance period. We have the Tide class. They are <br> oilers, but they have the capacity to support a carrier task group in addition to providing it with fuel <br> across the range of logistics support that a carrier task group needs. That is why we are accelerating <br> the FSS programme. You are right that it has had some difficulties, but we are on schedule.<br>\",\"What is the IOC for that?<br>\",\"It is 2029 for the first phase.<br>\",\"Very quickly, yet again, General, we have a situation where we have a critical and very expensive <br> capability---for the record, my father was in the Royal Navy and I am as pro carrier as you are going <br> to find---that hangs on some extremely old warships, because the new warships to replace them are <br> running years late. There is definitely a pattern here, is there not?<br>\",\"I agree.<br>\",\"So why not do something about it?<br>\",\"We are. That is why we have commissioned Type 31, Type 26 and FSS. That is why we are commissioning <br> MRSS. We know that many, although not all, of our current maritime platform capabilities are coming <br> to the end of their life. You are articulating the recapitalisation programme of our fleet. That is <br> precisely why we are doing it. Are there some delays in some of those programmes? Yes, there are. We <br> accept that, and that is why we are doing all that we can.<br>\",\"Forgive me, but we do not accept that. That is why we are here. I have two more quick questions and <br> then I will come back to the Chair. For the LPDs or amphibious assault ships, the out-of-service date <br> for Albion and Bulwark is 2034.<br>\",\"It is 2032.<br>\",\"It was 2034 in the PQ that I got the other day, but, if I am wrong, I will buy you a drink. I thought <br> that it was 2034. We will argue about that later.<br>\",\"We will take the general's date.<br>\",\"Is the reason that they now seem to be in play because they are old---they still have nearly the best <br> part of a decade left, whichever one of the two of us you believe---or is it because you cannot <br> crew them?<br>\",\"If we go back to the Westminster/Argyll conversation, the Secretary of State has not made a decision <br> about the future of Albion and Bulwark at the moment.<br>\",\"My question is why it is even an issue.<br>\",\"At the very start of this Committee conversation, we accepted that we have workforce issues across <br> the Armed Forces. Therefore, we need to look at the totality of those pressures when we look to start <br> to crew some of these new capabilities that you have talked about.<br>\",\"So it is workforce issues and crewing.<br>\",\"Crewing is definitely an issue within the Royal Navy. We accept that. As to whether that is the driver <br> for whatever decision the Secretary of State makes with regards to the two LPDs, there are a range <br> of issues associated with that.<br>\",\"I realise that you are sitting here in lovat green, so it is a difficult question, but thank you. <br> Lastly, on SSNs or attack submarines, we will not talk about the deterrent in open session, but it is <br> widely known and reported on all sorts of websites that, a few months ago, we did not have a single <br> attack submarine at sea, because they were spotted all tied up either in Faslane or in Devonport. <br> That has not happened for, crikey, half a century. Why did we not have a single attack submarine at <br> sea?<br>\",\"I am not going to get into the detail of the operational readiness of our SSN fleet.<br>\",\"Just give us a rough idea.<br>\",\"We are quite clear on the numbers. We have one Trafalgar class left, and we have four at sea, with <br> a fifth Astute class soon.<br>\",\"With respect, there was no operational readiness. That is the point. They were all tied up.<br>\",\"The operational availability of these platforms and, in fact, the totality of their capability change <br> on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis, depending on what the operational tasking is. I do not think <br> that you would expect me to sit here and give a detailed account of the operational readiness of <br> our SSNs.<br>\",\"General, I am very proud to have had a father at D-Day on a minesweeper. Across the Navy, it is the <br> most godawful mess at the moment, is it not? We have just been through class by class. It is a mess, <br> is it not?<br>\",\"I would disagree. There is no doubt that we have we have workforce pressures, as the Permanent <br> Secretary has said, including in the Navy, but, as the Secretary of State made clear yesterday and in his <br> speech last week, we are about to launch Steadfast Defender, which sees something like 40% of the <br> total commitment of that exercise across the alliance coming from United Kingdom Armed Forces, including <br> the Royal Navy and a carrier task group.<br>\",\"I will meet you halfway. You said, \\\"We have workforce pressures\\\", which comes right back to where we <br> started. They are leaving at three times the rate that we can replace them. The workforce pressures <br> are more important than any programmatic that I have just mentioned. If there is no crew, no ship <br> goes to sea.<br>\",\"Inflation has been covered, but we have also been talking about costing uncertainty. I am looking at <br> paragraph 1.27 in the NAO Report, which says, \\\"The MoD reflects this uncertainty by recording and <br> monitoring two levels of risk\\\". The first is \\\"risk inside cost (RIC), which is risk that the MoD judges <br> will probably occur and so includes it in its forecast costs\\\". It then goes on to say, \\\"RIC has <br> increased from £13.2 billion in last year's plan (5% of forecast costs) to £22.8 billion this year <br> (8% of forecast costs)\\\". Mr Wipperman, what proportion of the RIC is inflation?<br>\",\"I would not be able to say explicitly how much of that risk increase is just to do with inflation. <br> The risk inside costing is available to projects within their specific budget to deal with problems <br> or challenges that might emerge as they go through their programme. Some will reflect inflation for <br> those projects that see that as a risk. Some will be other risks. The reason why it has gone up is <br> partly a reflection, as the NAO points out, that we have a growing budget---and you would expect it to <br> grow---but it is also a recognition by us and by projects that we have been in a more volatile <br> economic context. As a result, the level of provision available to projects should go up. That is why <br> you see an increase. As I said, some of it will be for inflation, and some for other risks and issues <br> that we are dealing with.<br>\",\"But you cannot break those figures down.<br>\",\"I cannot. I can break down inflation overall and where we are seeing inflation rises. We are seeing <br> inflation in the equipment plan of about £11 billion. On top of that, we have about £2 billion of <br> fuel and forex. While that does not directly translate into the risk, that is additional cost pressure <br> that we are seeing through the plan. Outside the equipment plan, we have about another £5 billion <br> of inflation forecast risk, which is to do with utilities and energy costs, and the cost of maintenance <br> in the estate, as well as about £6 billion to do with the consequences of the consolidated pay <br> awards. In big handfuls, it is equipment and materials, infrastructure, utilities and energy costs, <br> forex and pay.<br>\",\"That is helpful. That is what I wanted. You said that it has gone up. It has gone up by 63%, which <br> is rather significant. Do you currently expect a similar increase this year, given that inflation is <br> coming down?<br>\",\"We are in the process right now of putting together the planning round for this year. We are analysing <br> returns from TLBs to see how costs are playing through to them. In this plan in front of you, on <br> top of that risk provision, we are holding £4 billion of contingency available across the plan as a <br> whole, which is not allocated to any project and is available to us to deploy, should further issues <br> occur.<br>\",\"What do you mean when you say that you are working it out again at the moment?<br>\",\"That is for this year's plan.<br>\",\"At what point do you draw sticks on the inflation figure?<br>\",\"Probably towards mid-February, given the way our planning works, we will need to take a snapshot and <br> say that that is the point at which we take a view. We do that for other variables as well, such as <br> forex.<br>\",\"General Magowan, what are the capability consequences for our Armed Forces of the plan being unaffordable?<br>\",\"As I have said to Committees before, it is about balancing the risk against the budget that we are given.<br>\",\"What is that risk?<br>\",\"The financial risk?<br>\",\"No, your capability risk.<br>\",\"I have mentioned the operational capability risks publicly before. Those areas where, if I gave you <br> my top four or five, we know that we need to invest more are lessons from not just Ukraine but <br> operations that we are seeing unfolding around the world.<br>\",\"If I were allowed to say only one thing, it would be straight lethality, which the Permanent Secretary <br> has already mentioned. You cannot deter major state-on-state conflict if you cannot prove that <br> you can close with and kill the enemy. To do, that you need lethality, so we need greater munitions <br> stockpiles. Related to that, we need a strong industrial base to be able to produce that, which is a <br> sovereign capability. That would probably be my number one.<br>\",\"If I were allowed another two or three in answering your question---but we are balancing these---it <br> is clear that the battlespace of today and tomorrow is such that there are a lot of things flying <br> through the air and trying to do us harm. Therefore, we need the ability to deliver what we call <br> IAMD---or integrated air missile defence. We have a missile defence capability within the UK Armed Forces <br> and within NATO, but we all agree across NATO that it needs to be deeper and broader.<br>\",\"How confident are you that those three priorities that you have set out are going to be included in <br> what Mr Williams puts forward to Ministers and what will actually be delivered?<br>\",\"This is a fundamental question. The point here is that we must demonstrate that the programme of <br> record---and both Mr Wipperman and the Permanent Secretary have made it clear that there are uncommitted <br> elements within the programme of record out to 10 years---is not fixed from now until 2034 as far <br> as our budget is concerned. Therefore, we have to be flexible in identifying those areas that are <br> uncommitted and whether they are a higher or lower priority than the areas that I have just articulated, <br> and there are probably a couple of others.<br>\",\"As I have said here before, from a military capability perspective, we will have to make hard-edged <br> decisions about deleting, de-scoping or potentially deferring---we will see---to ensure that there <br> is headroom to get after the things that we have just been talking about, and we will do that.<br>\",\"Given the international developments that you just alluded to in North Korea, Ukraine, China and the <br> Middle East, do the Armed Forces currently have what they need to meet those demands?<br>\",\"Yes. This is state-on-state deterrence. We are part of a broad alliance, and my firm judgment and <br> those of my seniors is that we are deterring state-on-state conflict. NATO is not at war. It is deterring <br> state-on-state conflict, and we are part of that. Does that mean that we are not carrying any <br> operational risk? Does that mean that we not do not need to adjust the programme of record to meet <br> those operational risks? No, absolutely not. There are things that we are going to need to invest in. <br> Are we deterring today? Yes, we are. If we need to go to war tonight, we can.<br>\",\"Earlier in the Committee, you said that we need to be ready for changes. Are we ready for those <br> changes? Do we have enough resilience built into the system currently to deal with those international <br> developments that we just spoke about?<br>\",\"Yes, we do, and that is our challenge.<br>\",\"In terms of the plan, as you had alluded to, we said that not all of the cost pressures that are <br> developed into the new capabilities are costed. Mr Williams, why do you not know how much it would cost <br> to deliver all the capabilities set out in the refreshed defence command paper?<br>\",\"I think that you are referring to a list at table 5 in the report. Some of the items on that list <br> generally refer to areas where there are choices about what we might do. We have not yet decided, for <br> instance, whether we go for a midlife upgrade of the Meteor long-range air-to-air missile and precisely <br> what that means. The scope of any work is still a decision that we need to make. There are examples <br> where there are decisions still to come.<br>\",\"There are examples where we have funded early-stage feasibility and development work, but are still <br> to make a decision on the scale and timing of production. There are programmes where we are working <br> with international partners, so the level of funding that they might bring to a programme is still <br> in negotiation.<br>\",\"To the general point earlier---I will probably make the same offer as I did to Sir Geoffrey <br> Clifton-Brown---in our internal view of the programme, we have a good sense of those kinds of decisions that <br> are coming down the track. Over a 10-year period, we expect to have more headroom and choice in the <br> budget in the back end of the programme, so we are thinking about how we can bring those in at the <br> appropriate time, but I accept that it is not necessarily the most transparent part of our planning <br> process in the documentation or the data that we set out.<br>\",\"No, I would say it is as clear as mud. In terms of the 2.5% increase in defence spending, what happens <br> if that gamble of yours does not pay off and you do not receive that before you need it to complete <br> some of these programmes? Coming back to one of the points that you made earlier, you said, \\\"How <br> do we set a programme without knowing how much money we have?\\\" Why do you not help the people setting <br> the budget by telling them what your priorities are?<br>\",\"It is not a gamble. It is stated Government policy to increase the defence budget to 2.5% of GDP as <br> economic conditions allow.<br>\",\"That is like when I ask my mum, \\\"When is dinner going to be ready?\\\" and she says, \\\"How long is a <br> piece of string?\\\" If you cannot give us a guaranteed time, or at least a timescale, for this increase <br> in budget, how can you be certain that you are going to be able to deliver the programmes that you <br> need to deliver?<br>\",\"To use your analogy, in quite a lot of the conversations that we have with the Treasury, as you might <br> imagine, we are explaining that we are quite hungry now. In the end, it is a matter for the Prime <br> Minister and for the Chancellor, and those are decisions about spending priorities for Government <br> that are properly made in a spending review. Were the Government to change that and to come off 2.5% <br> as their funding ambition, there would need to be conversations about the level of capability that we <br> could buy for the budget that they then agree.<br>\",\"How much wriggle room do you have if the spending review were to be delayed, say, for a general election?<br>\",\"We are working through some short-term pressure, as I said at the beginning. Last week in the House, <br> the Prime Minister suggested that the spending review might be in 2025 rather than in late 2024, <br> but we are talking about six months or so here or there.<br>\",\"Just to be clear for people who might be tuning in, if there were a general election in the autumn, <br> there could not be a spending review at that point. If whatever Government were elected would like <br> to have a budget shortly after a general election, the next spending review is typically around six <br> months after a budget. Is that the sort of thinking that you are going through in the Ministry of <br> Defence?<br>\",\"There needs to be a local government financial settlement by December of each year.<br>\",\"There have been previous examples not that long ago of rolling over an existing spending review by <br> just carrying it on.<br>\",\"What I am particularly interested in is when we get to the point of a multi-year settlement, and that <br> may well be at a period of time after a general election.<br>\",\"So you are expecting to get to a multi-year settlement.<br>\",\"We had a multi-year settlement at the last spending review and, for defence, that makes sense.<br>\",\"Just to be clear, you are planning on that basis.<br>\",\"Yes.<br>\",\"Our overall priorities are articulated in the defence command paper refresh. We have said that, and <br> we now need to go into a level of detail beneath that, but we have articulated those. From a military <br> capability perspective, we need a long-term settlement. We need a five-year settlement to give us <br> the confidence, particularly with industry, to get after that long-term deterrence that I have been <br> talking about. We cannot live year on year.<br>\",\"Absolutely, I completely understand that, but what you are asking for is completely unfunded at the <br> moment.<br>\",\"It is not that it is completely unfunded, because we make a set of reasonable assumptions about how <br> the budget might develop beyond the spending review period. Even on a multi-year settlement, there <br> are going to be two or maybe three spending reviews over the period that we are looking at. In the <br> separate information that I sent to the Committee, we set out a central assumption around the overall <br> budget, a downside assumption and an upside assumption. They are simply that---assumptions. We are <br> not looking for a completely blank sheet of paper, but the precise settlement is to be decided.<br>\",\"But there is a blank space of £12 billion within that.<br>\",\"It depends very heavily on assumptions about the budget and the content of the programme, what that <br> programme costs and how we need to deliver it.<br>\",\"That is a long way of saying that, at the moment, you want to do more than you have money for, which <br> is why we are here today.<br>\",\"You said that you wanted a five-year contract so that you could give security to suppliers for the <br> programmes, but should they not be taking the risk, rather than the Government?<br>\",\"Mr Start may want to come in on that, and maybe I will come back.<br>\",\"Companies can reasonably take risk when they have a reasonable chance of an economic return. The <br> challenge that we have at the moment is that there is incredible volatility in the nature of the threat. <br> In the Ukraine conflict at the moment, we are seeing technological changes within a 90-day period. <br> That means that, for the equipment that we think we need, we make our best guess now, but we need <br> to be very adaptable and change it. The risk of that becomes a military rather than a commercial <br> one.<br>\",\"If you are sitting in industry, you can take sensible risk-based decisions around skills. We are <br> seeing that with very substantial investment in skills by the likes of BAE Systems, Babcock and others <br> in terms of building underlying capability, but it is very hard to make firm decisions around production <br> capacity or particular products.<br>\",\"That is exacerbated by the fact that, in the defence market, which is not a regular consumer market <br> but one that is heavily influenced by Government policies in different countries, you can sell only <br> when there is aligned Government support for the products that you need in terms of exports. It is <br> not a natural market, and making a strategic investment choice is extremely difficult for industry to <br> do without Government giving it very clear signals.<br>\",\"In the UK, we try to publish as much of the defence pipeline as we can, and we have been increasingly <br> doing a better job of that. We try to do that by engaging industry early in terms of the requirements, <br> and General Rob has been doing groundbreaking work in terms of involving industry at high levels <br> of classification, so it has a better insight than it would have otherwise. In the NATO context, <br> we are trying to do that through the Conference of National Armaments Directors.<br>\",\"Without Government giving it appropriate guidelines, the industry cannot make long-term commitments, <br> because the chances of it developing something that does not get sold is high.<br>\",\"Why are we not buying off-the-shelf products from other countries that have already taken this risk, <br> particularly if you need it quickly---as you said, a 90-day one?<br>\",\"All countries have the same underlying dynamic problem. Together with our allies, we have to paint <br> as clear a picture as we can of the future need. Wherever possible, we, as Governments, benefit from <br> having interoperable and interchangeable products with other allies. We benefit from when we develop <br> products together, as we are doing with things like GCAP.<br>\",\"Just buying off the shelf leaves you in a situation where you might benefit in the very short term, <br> but, over the longer term, you do not have the level of sovereign ability to adapt and change the <br> military need. In times of conflict, if you do not have national capability, it is very difficult to <br> adapt at speed.<br>\",\"Our overall acquisition strategy has to be a blend of having onshore capability, so that we have that <br> sovereign independence, economic growth and jobs, but, also for security reasons, a mixture of <br> international partnerships and some things that we would buy off the shelf because it is much more <br> economic to do.<br>\",\"We will touch more on the industrial strategy side of this shortly.<br>\",\"Mr Start, I cannot help pondering the answer that you gave to the last question. I might refer you <br> to Ajax, where you would have had a vehicle fully in operation by now if you had bought off the shelf, <br> but we are not going to go there.<br>\",\"Mr Williams, going back to my earlier question, we have been over and over the nuclear enterprise <br> funding gap in the budget of £7.9 billion and the total budget gap of £16.9 billion. How are we going <br> to close that gap?<br>\",\"Yes, so £7.9 billion of the £16.9 billion is currently showing against the nuclear enterprise. Our <br> initial experience within the nuclear ringfence that we have been operating this year is that our <br> first set of cost estimations have been about right. We will deliver within that budget without deliberately <br> having had to slow programmes down.<br>\",\"Part of the way in which we manage that cost pressure will be through the exceptional flexibilities <br> that we have agreed with the Treasury for the nuclear ring-fence, which will allow us both to commit <br> spend at pace through more streamlined approvals processes and to bring money forward and backward <br> to address risk as it begins to crystallise.<br>\",\"It reflects about 7% of the nuclear budget over the 10-year period. At this stage, my expectation is <br> that that level of financial pressure will be broadly manageable.<br>\",\"I am absolutely certain that the flexibility you have gained from the Treasury is very useful, but <br> how likely is it that in next funding reviews you are going to need to come back and ask for more <br> money for the nuclear enterprise?<br>\",\"I cannot rule it out, but part of the reason for the particular increase in this planning round is <br> that we deliberately asked our colleagues working in the nuclear enterprise to make sure that they <br> were being comprehensive and risk-aware in the numbers that they put in.<br>\",\"There are always adjustments up and down, but, in comparison to previous planning rounds, this is a <br> much less financially risky position and a more comprehensive view not only within the Defence Nuclear <br> Organisation but in allied top-level budget areas. Nuclear costs within the Royal Navy and Strategic <br> Command have been included within that ring-fence.<br>\",\"There has been quite a lot of de-risking in this planning round. It is often in the nature of nuclear <br> costs that they can move around, but this is a much healthier position than we have been in for a <br> number of years, in my view.<br>\",\"\\\"We are in a much healthier position than we have been in for a number of years\\\". That is a really <br> interesting statement.<br>\",\"Mr Wipperman, given that the nuclear enterprise budget is consuming such a large proportion of the <br> total budget, how likely is it that, in order to fund it, you are going to have to further cut <br> conventional weapons over the next 10 years?<br>\",\"The answer to that partly goes back to what the Permanent Secretary has been saying about potential <br> future funding scenarios. The letter that the Permanent Secretary sent to the Committee set out some <br> of those scenarios. In one of those scenarios, the funding for nuclear that we receive from the <br> Treasury continues. That leaves you with this £7.9 billion, which, as we have set out, we think is <br> manageable over a £100 billion 10-year budget.<br>\",\"That is predicated on, as Ms Owen says, the Treasury granting you this extra 2.5% of GDP. If you do <br> not get that, does that answer still stand?<br>\",\"I was going to go on to say that in the lower-bound scenarios that we set out, where we have a lower <br> budget than we might currently forecast, we would have to work with Ministers about the sorts of <br> choices available to them and where they would want to balance capabilities.<br>\",\"Just to be clear, in the central budget scenario, which generates the £7.9 billion, we have made no <br> assumption about progress to the 2.5% as a policy choice. That is in our upside budget scenario.<br>\",\"Yes.<br>\",\"It does assume that £7.9 billion.<br>\",\"Yes.<br>\",\"Yes, it does.<br>\",\"Otherwise you will be left with a scenario where you will have to cut conventional spending, if you <br> do not get that 2.5% of GDP expenditure.<br>\",\"Yes, if the nuclear enterprise is unable to manage the costs within the funding envelope that we <br> expect to give it, and if at that point we choose to find savings in the non-nuclear side of the programme <br> rather than deliver nuclear within the ring-fence. There are some variables there.<br>\",\"That is understood. Mr Wipperman, very briefly because time is moving on, what capacity did the <br> delivery agency and industry have to deliver the nuclear programme more quickly and therefore help save <br> costs?<br>\",\"Mr Start might be better placed on some of the industry, but, in terms of how we put together the <br> plan, the forecast is based on the defence nuclear enterprise, the Defence Nuclear Organisation and <br> the associated elements giving their judgment working with industry about its ability to deliver.<br>\",\"At the spring Budget this time, in March 2023, we received an extra £3 billion spend for nuclear, £1 <br> billion for this year and £2 billion for next. We currently forecast that we are on track to spend <br> that extra funding and to get that out through the supply chain. We did a lot of work with the DNO <br> to get an assessment of realistic spend profiles. Currently, we think we will be able to deliver, but <br> Mr Start may be better placed to talk about it more broadly.<br>\",\"If I can come in first, last year Ministers announced a nuclear skills taskforce looking at both <br> defence and civil nuclear skills requirements in the round. Our assumptions going into that work, based <br> on some earlier internal reviews, have been that across the defence nuclear enterprise over the <br> course of around a 10-year period we will probably need an extra 10,000 or so apprentices, graduate <br> engineers and so on to deliver on the totality of the defence nuclear ambition.<br>\",\"That skills taskforce made good progress over the back end of last year. A report will shortly be <br> with Ministers for them to consider. The announcement on that will get to the heart of your question.<br>\",\"This question is either to you, Mr Williams, or to Mr Start. We have talked about speeding up the <br> defence nuclear enterprise to save money. Does the same argument still apply to the conventional weapons <br> budget---that, if you could speed up some of the programmes, you would be able to save money and <br> make the programme more affordable?<br>\",\"Yes. Both in hearings here and in the Defence Sub-Committee that Mr Francois chaired, there was a <br> renewed and welcome emphasis on pace. That will be a key feature of the announcements by Ministers <br> around our new procurement model. In a world of high inflation, delivering more quickly, or at least <br> delivering on time, avoids inflationary cost pressures.<br>\",\"In the kind of uncertain world that we are in---we have talked in the defence command paper about <br> sprinting to a 70% or 80% capability and then spiralling---getting usable capability into the hands of <br> the warfighter more quickly is the capability ambition. That is the most important piece. It has <br> the advantage of probably allowing you to deliver it more cheaply.<br>\",\"Can you give us an exemplar---it will probably be one of those green projects in the GMPP---of a <br> project that is well ahead of schedule at the moment and that you are proud of?<br>\",\"We only have one green project in the GMPP. No, we have two. I do not know whether General Rob wants <br> to comment.<br>\",\"Can I take it from the other angle? We accept the challenge that, with all the programmes here, in <br> quarter 3, 11 of them are at red. Half of those are in the areas that you have just been talking about, <br> so complex weapons or the nuclear enterprise.<br>\",\"To support what the Permanent Secretary said, there are a range of reasons for that.<br>\",\"I was not really going into those. I just wanted one exemplar of which you are proud that it is being <br> delivered on time or even ahead of budget.<br>\",\"A number of the Air Force programmes are developing well. We have had F-35B success.<br>\",\"That was a conventionally established programme.<br>\",\"Yes, but you are asking for a major programme, a cat A programme, that is delivering to cost and <br> time. We are rolling that out. We now have the second squadron up and running. We will have 48 F-35Bs <br> certainly delivered from 2025. We are looking to grow that to 74. There is an example of a programme <br> that is delivering operational capability today.<br>\",\"Sir Geoffrey, if you look at some of the things we have done for Ukraine, we have tried to take these <br> opportunities around acceleration that we are trying to build into the longer-term system. We have <br> then been able to be very successful in delivering a lot of capability very quickly.<br>\",\"An example is the acquisition of Archer, where we replenished using an existing off-the-shelf capability <br> at real speed. A second example is the way that we have introduced the use of both armed and <br> unarmed drones, taking technology from concept through to operation in weeks and months rather than <br> years and decades. There are some really exciting opportunities that we have demonstrated in that <br> space.<br>\",\"We are trying to roll out that kind of approach, where we take more operational risk, get our <br> capabilities out more quickly and then spiral up. We are doing that in the conventional weapons space, in <br> particular in munitions. In the munitions space, we rolled out capabilities to protect our warships, <br> equipping Lynx with a capability early for both FASGW-light and FASGW-heavy. Those are Martlet and <br> Sea Venom, off the top of my head.<br>\",\"It is Wildcat.<br>\",\"In both cases, we got a capability out quickly and then we spiralled that capability up by increasing <br> its capability over time. That is the approach that we need to use much more widely.<br>\",\"We are also trying to take approaches that are more modular. Within the Boxer programme, similar to <br> the concept of the Type 31 programme, we get out the basic capability that is the underlying platform, <br> and then we can enhance that platform with mission modules and enhanced capabilities over time. <br> That gives us a solid basis but allows us to be flexible and spiral in capabilities more quickly.<br>\",\"We are used to asking critical questions in this Committee, but congratulations. The UK is recognised <br> around the world as having got those capabilities out very quickly.<br>\",\"Can I just go back to F-35, General Magowan? We have been following this for some time. We had the <br> aircraft carriers without the aircraft, but we still have issues about the number that we need to have <br> full capability. We are still quite far short of what we need to do. It is a programme that is <br> beginning to deliver, but it is still behind where it ideally ought to be, given that we need those to <br> make the carrier group operate fully and effectively. We also need the crew. That is another area <br> that we have looked at, along with the training for pilots.<br>\",\"Yes, for engineers, rather than pilots.<br>\",\"There were also some pilot training issues.<br>\",\"The extra 168 engineers has been the pinch point, which we have now funded. We are now growing those <br> 168.<br>\",\"When you say you are growing them, are you training them from within the service?<br>\",\"Yes, so the headmark for us is two squadrons operationally deployed on Carrier Strike Group 25.<br>\",\"With two squadrons, if you have any number of aircraft out of commission, you are struggling. You <br> really need three, do you not, to make sure that you have full capability?<br>\",\"The programme of record at the moment is designed to deliver three squadrons. We are rewriting the <br> routine operating model at the moment. It is going to the Secretary of State in the next few weeks <br> and months. There will be a ramp-up from what we originally said back in 2017. Either way, the headmark <br> is for three operational squadrons by the early 2030s, but in the short to medium term there will <br> be two squadrons operationally deployed with a training unit, an OCU, by 2025.<br>\",\"We are on schedule for that.<br>\",\"Yes, we are.<br>\",\"Mr Start, for the record, when the Defence Sub-Committee looked at DNS, as you know, we were critical <br> in a number of areas, but, on the principle of credit where it is due, we gave your organisation <br> a lot of credit for everything you have done for the Ukrainians. Today, by the same token, for the <br> record, it is worth recording in public session that, because your teams worked unbelievably hard, <br> although we cannot quantify the number of Ukrainian lives you have saved, it will probably be in the <br> thousands. Perhaps you will be kind enough to carry back the compliments of this Committee to all of <br> your people at DE&S who pulled out all the stops to do that.<br>\",\"Thank you, Mr Francois. It is much appreciated.<br>\",\"That was the good bit. Mr Williams, can I just check something that you said earlier just to make <br> sure we understood what you said?<br>\",\"You have a problem. This is a 10-year plan, but you only know how much public spending that you have <br> going forward three years. That is always a challenge. Am I right that you said from 2027, so the <br> back end of this plan, the second half really, you were using more optimistic financial assumptions---i.e. <br> that by then we will be spending about 2.5% of GDP on defence? Did I understand you <br> correctly?<br>\",\"All of the analysis is based on data that we have shared with the NAO. That 16.9% budgetary pressure <br> is based on a central assumption. I have made no assumptions in that about a trajectory to 2.5% of <br> GDP at all.<br>\",\"You have not.<br>\",\"We have an upside budget scenario. This is not based on any agreement with the Treasury. It is a set <br> of assumptions that looks at what a growth of 2.5% of GDP by the end of the 10-year planning period, <br> starting at the end of the next spending review period---let us say 2027-28---would look like.<br>\",\"If you get the \\\"optimistic\\\" outcome from your point of view, and mine too by the way, does that <br> deficit disappear?<br>\",\"Yes, except that there is obviously a mismatch of profile because that gives you more money in the <br> last five years of the plan.<br>\",\"It all fits, though.<br>\",\"It fits across the 10-year period.<br>\",\"I have one more, very quickly, and then I will go into some specifics. With the £17 billion deficit, <br> what proportion of GDP are we spending on defence in that scenario? In your central assumption, what <br> is your percentage assumption?<br>\",\"This is to fill the gap.<br>\",\"Is it 2.2%, 2.25% or 2.3%?<br>\",\"On the current assumptions that are built in this, based on the latest OBR forecast from November, <br> by the end of the decade it will be about 2.1% of GDP.<br>\",\"This plan with the £17 billion \\\"black hole\\\", to use media language, is based on us spending 2.1% of <br> GDP on defence, plus Ukraine.<br>\",\"No, it makes no assumption about the future of Ukraine. This financial year, we are forecasting 2.25% <br> including Ukraine. Next year, we are forecasting 2.26% including Ukraine. We have no agreed funding <br> for Ukraine.<br>\",\"All right, I have got that. When the agreed funding runs out, it is based on 2.1%.<br>\",\"No, it will reach 2.1% in year 10 of this plan. It will be a downward trajectory year on year on that <br> current forecast, but you would get to 2.1%, starting at 2.26%. It will be 2.26% in year 2 and 2.1% <br> in year 10.<br>\",\"If it were to be 2.5% in an ideal world, that black hole disappears. I have got it. That is very clear.<br>\",\"Just taking this year, the difference between 2.25% and 2.5% of GDP is about £6 billion or £7 billion.<br>\",\"We get the point that many of the costs are frontloaded. We have got that. That is very helpful. Let <br> us come on to the RAG ratings, the colours, very quickly.<br>\",\"For the benefit of our thousands of viewers abroad, the National Audit Office, which prepared this <br> Report, is Parliament's auditor, not the Government's. The Government, since 2012, have had their own <br> auditor called the Infrastructure Projects Authority, or IPA for short, nothing to do with a particular <br> brand of beer. It goes through all the major Government infrastructure programmes, including in <br> defence, and the biggest is Dreadnought. Then it assigns a RAG rating, red, amber or green, to each <br> programme.<br>\",\"We have got into muddles in the past about which colours to use because sometimes you use slightly <br> different colours. We are using the IPA colours, for the avoidance of doubt. It is page 37, paragraph <br> 211. Of the 52 that it looked at, six were classified and so have not been rated, so 46 of the 52 <br> had a rating. Five were red; 35 were amber; and two, only two, were green. Green is defined as, <br> \\\"Successful delivery on time, budget and quality appears highly likely\\\". By my maths, of the 52, that is <br> barely 4%. That is awful, is it not, Mr Williams?<br>\",\"As we have discussed previously, we are absolutely not complacent about the number that are amber. <br> There are a range of technical, commercial and delivery challenges in getting our most major and <br> complex programmes delivered.<br>\",\"The proportion of red, amber and green is not materially out of kilter with the IPA's reviews of more <br> conventional programmes in terms of infrastructure and construction, Government transformation and <br> IT delivery.<br>\",\"Mr Williams, forgive me. We understand that, but we are not going to deter Vladimir Putin with HS2, <br> whether we have the extra leg or not.<br>\",\"Let us come back to this point. The definition of amber---most of them are amber---is, \\\"Delivery <br> appears feasible but significant issues already exist, requiring management attention\\\". That is still <br> something to worry about. Red, for the record, means, \\\"Successful delivery appears to be <br> unachievable\\\".<br>\",\"The red projects include the future combat air system, GCAP, Tempest, which is embarrassing, the core <br> production capability for nuclear submarine reactors, which is embarrassing, MODNet Evolve---okay, <br> that is still embarrassing---the Brimstone 3 air-to-surface weapon and the SPEAR cap 3 air-to-air <br> weapon.<br>\",\"We have just signed a treaty with the Japanese and the Italians for the future combat air system, <br> and yet the Government's own auditor says the programme is red.<br>\",\"We should just be clear. The IPA is not quite an auditor. I know you are using shorthand, Mr Francois.<br>\",\"They are the programme delivery experts in Government.<br>\",\"Red means, \\\"Successful delivery appears to be unachievable\\\". We just signed an international treaty <br> with two other nations. That is a bit embarrassing, is it not?<br>\",\"Colleagues may want to come in on the detail, particularly General Rob on GCAP. This is about the <br> degree of difficulty in delivering against the planned 2035 in-service date.<br>\",\"There are examples---you will ask me now to give you one, and I will probably have to write to you---of <br> programmes that are rated red, which, as a result of intervention, re-scoping or throwing additional <br> resource at them, you can recover from red to amber.<br>\",\"David, I am sorry. I will save you a letter. F-35 was red last year, from memory.<br>\",\"Thank you, yes.<br>\",\"It is now amber. That is right, is it not? There is still a long way to go, as Dame Meg was saying, <br> but F-35 is slowly going in the right direction and not the wrong direction, is it not, General?<br>\",\"Yes, absolutely.<br>\",\"That is just to prove we were listening to you.<br>\",\"Yes, it does not look good. It is very difficult to talk generically, though. There are 52 programmes <br> in there and there are a range of reasons. We do have to get into the specifics of the programmes, <br> which we can do. I have it all here.<br>\",\"There are some general trends, and the Permanent Secretary has already alluded to one of them, which <br> is SQEP---you used the expression---suitably qualified and experienced personnel. That is true <br> particularly across the nuclear space---there are a number of nuclear reds---and the technical spaces <br> associated with defence, digital and complex weapons.<br>\",\"Some of these are difficult international negotiations, which involve political conversations. That <br> can lead to deliberation. Those would be my top three.<br>\",\"General Rob, you have said that it is difficult to generalise, but these have all been examined in <br> great detail by the IPA. It has not generalised; it has scrutinised all of them individually and then <br> given them a RAG rating. In that sense, they are not generalisations.<br>\",\"Even if you take out the classified programmes, there are only two green out of 46, one of which, <br> ironically, is the fleet solid support ship. By my maths, that is still less than 5%. In pub English, <br> barely one in 20 of these procurement programmes is running to time and cost. That is appalling, is <br> it not?<br>\",\"They are the 50 most complex things that we are trying to do, so it does not surprise me that at <br> various points in project lives they are not really---<br>\",\"Mr Williams, the taxpayer employs you people on a lot more than we are getting in order to make these <br> complex things go right, do they not?<br>\",\"That complexity is the reason why we think P50 is an unsafe assumption.<br>\",\"Just explain P50. We understand it.<br>\",\"As the Permanent Secretary says, these are the most complex projects. The nuclear ones are probably <br> at the top of the list. We plan on the probability of us hitting our milestones being 50%, on a normal <br> bell curve. Because of the complexity of the nuclear enterprise, and we are trying to get to a <br> point where we are trying to be more realistic, we have now determined that it is better to be at <br> P70.<br>\",\"That is good. We wanted P75.<br>\",\"It is P70 for the nuclear enterprise.<br>\",\"The problem with P50, again in pub English, is that you have half as much chance of being wrong as <br> you have of being right. If I went to buy a car, I would not say to the car dealer, \\\"Is there a P50 <br> chance that it might start when I turn the key?\\\" I would not buy the car.<br>\",\"Mr Francois, you have quoted what amber is. Just to be clear, I will give the full definition so that <br> we can get an answer from the witnesses about what they are doing in this respect. The definition <br> of an amber project is, \\\"Successful delivery appears feasible but significant issues already exist, <br> requiring management attention\\\" and then, crucially, \\\"These appear resolvable at this stage and, if <br> addressed promptly, should not present a cost/schedule overrun\\\". It might be helpful if you could <br> pluck a couple of amber examples and tell us what you are doing to address them promptly so they do <br> not cause a cost or schedule overrun.<br>\",\"That is footnote 12 on page 37.<br>\",\"Yes, indeed. Mr Start, perhaps you would respond.<br>\",\"I would be delighted to do so. If I may, I will speak to red briefly. What is helpful about this <br> system is that it allows us as delivery agents to focus on where really senior management attention is <br> needed.<br>\",\"In the case of the couple of reds that are within my portfolio, one of them is red because the supplier <br> has some really difficult technical issues that it is wrestling with. That is making it late. It <br> will get there, but that is making it late. I could take that particular capability to war, if I <br> had to, but I would be doing so with increased risk. I do not want to do that unless I have to. That <br> is red in terms of meeting the obligations that we have set on it, but I can fight with it if I need <br> to.<br>\",\"The other one is red because I am waiting for a capability from an ally that I need to integrate that <br> platform on to. I do not have a date from them yet because they are working on some other things. <br> As a consequence, it is red because we just do not know a critical dependency. That makes it red. <br> When we have resolved that, it will come off red. It is flagged as red because it is not within our <br> control.<br>\",\"If I could take some amber ones, in general, we set pretty aggressive targets on our teams to deliver <br> capability because our military wants capability as quickly as possible and within a timeframe. <br> The targets that we set on the teams themselves are quite aggressive, and therefore I would expect most <br> project managers to say they are struggling to hold the aggressive times that we give them.<br>\",\"The Defence Sub-Committee chaired by Mr Francois made the recommendation that, while we might still <br> task the project teams that way, we should be holding reserves at a higher level and, in particular, <br> doing so on schedule. We have accepted that recommendation and are implementing that across the <br> board. We are moving to hold more contingency in terms of the overall schedules, but we will still drive <br> the teams aggressively because we want to get the capability into the hands of users.<br>\",\"You are in charge of that contingency. You are not giving it away easily.<br>\",\"Yes, indeed. That is the key dynamic. If I may, why do we have so many?<br>\",\"We asked for examples. Can you give us some examples?<br>\",\"Let me take the example of Boxer. Boxer is currently amber. This is the MIV programme. On the Boxer <br> programme, we are currently just holding the IOC---initial operating capability---dates that we have <br> committed to, but they are under pressure. They are under pressure, as are most of the programmes <br> here, because of issues with supply chain componentry. That is true in the land, sea and air domain <br> and all of my international counterparts are having the same issues.<br>\",\"As we came out of Covid, as industry bounced back, the car industry, the commercial aviation industry <br> and others sucked out a lot of the component capacity as they started to rebuild their industries. <br> Suddenly, we went from a situation where our suppliers were assuming they could buy components in <br> two weeks off the factor market and some of them have gone out to over two years.<br>\",\"That means they are suddenly under real pressure to maintain the schedule because they cannot get <br> the components in the timeframe. That is starting to wash out at the component level and is now sitting <br> at the subsystem and assembly level. Across our suppliers, we are seeing real issues in that <br> space.<br>\",\"The second common issue that is driving all of them to feel pressure at the moment is skills. We have <br> a very hot market globally for these engineering skills. Getting those skills into the defence <br> industry is a real challenge. We need to work that skills issue in nuclear. My predecessor Sir Simon <br> Bollom is working on that in the nuclear space. Through the Defence Suppliers Forum, we are also working <br> with industry to try to get more apprenticeships and with higher education to pull more STEM <br> resources into the defence industry.<br>\",\"You made the point about holding that reserve. Presumably, we will hear more about that and you will <br> flesh that out in the statement, hopefully before 26 March.<br>\",\"Yes.<br>\",\"That is very helpful. My last one is about programmatics. Some of us have tabled a number of <br> parliamentary questions about how many contracts your Department holds with Fujitsu. You have come back and <br> said that that is commercial in confidence, which I have to say is an incredibly weak reply.<br>\",\"If you will not publish how many of those contracts you have---you were also asked about their duration <br> and their contract value---as this is the Public Accounts Committee, would you give an undertaking <br> to provide that information to the Committee in confidence?<br>\",\"Yes, in principle. I would need to check that.<br>\",\"We have previously had access to the entire strategic suppliers information. Admittedly, that was <br> under a humble address of the House.<br>\",\"You could save us going to all that trouble.<br>\",\"We may simply approach the Cabinet Office for the whole list.<br>\",\"Your in-principle answer is yes.<br>\",\"Yes.<br>\",\"That will do. Thank you very much.<br>\",\"I know what the answer is and I do not particularly see any problem with sharing it with you.<br>\",\"That is very good.<br>\",\"Finally, before we move on, having now read last year's report again, I have one final point. As well <br> as the F-35, five other programmes moved from red to amber in the latest published IPA review.<br>\",\"In terms of what we are doing on internal governance, the Minister for Defence Procurement has now <br> started a regular GMPP review meeting with a particular focus on the reds and ambers trending down. <br> At the delivery end in DE&S there is a programme of project review meetings led by non-executive <br> directors on Mr Start's board. We have followed up on some of the Sheldon recommendations about ensuring <br> that senior responsible owners have a direct route into me or senior sponsors in head office where <br> they are concerned about progress. We are taking the delivery governance seriously.<br>\",\"Can I just add one extra thing to what Mr Start said, just to bring it to life further? You gave <br> credit to DNS staff under Mr Start for what they have done in Ukraine.<br>\",\"Yes, absolutely right.<br>\",\"I can name three programmes in the DMPP that are red, which would go green tomorrow morning if we <br> were going to war tomorrow night. We would be able to deliver FASGW-heavy, Brimstone 3 and SPEAR cap <br> 3, if we needed to, but we are not prepared to take the level of risk that we are taking in Ukraine. <br> We just need to ensure that we are comparing apples with apples.<br>\",\"Can we take a bit more risk, then?<br>\",\"Let us not digress into other topics.<br>\",\"I will move on to supply chain constraints. I am going to start off with paragraph 2.5 of the NAO <br> Report. It says, \\\"The MoD is also facing supply chain risks and industry capacity constraints, mainly <br> due to skills gaps, shortages of key components and an increased demand for defence equipment in <br> other countries in response to the war in Ukraine\\\".<br>\",\"It then gives a series of examples, one of which is that the Army has said the lead time for the <br> delivery of semiconductors has increased from one to three weeks to more than 50 weeks. Mr Williams, <br> from your point of view, has the NAO report got it right? Are there these supply constraints that it <br> is talking about? What impact are they having on delivery of equipment plan projects?<br>\",\"Yes, they have got it right. That specific example around the Army experience and access to semiconductors <br> is directly relevant to the Boxer example that Mr Start talked about.<br>\",\"We have put in place a number of processes to give us better visibility below the prime contractor <br> level of our supply chain, including up to around 700 companies that are active in the UK defence <br> supply chain. We have been developing a measure of supply chain fragility or vulnerability. Given your <br> role on the Defence Suppliers Forum, Mr Start, I wonder whether you might want to expand on that.<br>\",\"This is a very different world to the one that we lived in five years ago. There is no doubt <br> significantly more pressure on raw materials and raw material access. Because of the war in Ukraine, there <br> is incredible demand for existing products and equipment. That is pressuring down through the supply <br> chain.<br>\",\"As a consequence of that, we have been having to work with the large primes within the Defence <br> Suppliers Forum. The DSF covers about 80 companies directly and then the whole of the supply chain through <br> the trade associations. We have been working with the large companies to make sure their supply <br> chain teams are discussing supply chain fragility.<br>\",\"We have also changed the defence conditions or DEFCONs. Within contracts, the primes now have to <br> provide us with visibility of the supply chain at least four levels down. We have created a supply chain <br> visibility toolset, which now allows us to map this very complex web of interrelated suppliers both <br> onshore and offshore. We can now see where things map.<br>\",\"That goes four tiers down.<br>\",\"Yes. For the most critical products we have also started to place investment in the supply chain <br> where there have been weaknesses and issues, particularly in things like munitions.<br>\",\"Within the Government's commitment to £560 million over two years in terms of improving defence <br> resilience, we have been spending that money on not only enhancing production capacity but also working <br> down through the supply chain particularly around chemicals, chemical supply and so on.<br>\",\"I will come back to the foreign aspect, which we have not really covered yet, but to what extent are <br> you reliant on delays that result in short-term savings but long-term overall cost increases? In <br> the NAO Report, the Type 23 frigate, where repair costs have increased by £23 million to £100 million, <br> is given as an example. To what extent are you using short-term savings but, as a result of that, <br> then being hit for much larger costs down the line?<br>\",\"We have to balance the budget in any particular year. That always creates pressures on spend-to-save <br> things that we would like to do but just cannot. That is a dynamic of defence. We have to make those <br> decisions. We try to prioritise the things that will give us the greatest benefit.<br>\",\"The other dynamic we are facing at the moment is that we are seeing a very high operational tempo of <br> our use of military assets. That means a number of assets that should be in for scheduled maintenance <br> are not because they are out on operational deployment. We are building up something of a maintenance <br> debt that we are going to have to work through as well. There are a few of those dynamics.<br>\",\"It is reflected in our equipment plan, if you look at paragraphs 1.21 and 1.22 in the report. The <br> phrase we use is \\\"management adjustment for realism\\\".<br>\",\"In putting the plans together, frontline commands, in conjunction with Mr Start's delivery teams or <br> delivery teams elsewhere, will make an assessment of the realism of being able to deliver the programme <br> in totality. Because we do not want to underspend---we want to get as much capability as we can <br> for the budget---that is being factored in particularly within the early years of the programme.<br>\",\"It is not particularly a deliberate slowing down of any one programme but an assumption that the <br> totality of the programme overall will probably arrive later than we have programmed.<br>\",\"It is certainly not deliberate in terms of the operational aspects you mentioned and things being <br> used. General, what are the capability implications of equipment being used and therefore not being <br> replaced?<br>\",\"That is why we have a replenishment programme for Ukraine. Mr Start and the team have got at that, <br> particularly with regards to some of our missile defence systems but more broadly as well. We know we <br> have to either replenish or take operational risk. That is why we have been given additional funding <br> to do that twice, in both the autumn statement and the spring statement.<br>\",\"Last week, on 15 January, as part of the \\\"Defending the UK and Allies\\\" statement, our colleague Jack <br> Lopresti asked the Prime Minister, \\\"Is it not time that we upscaled our industrial defence capacity <br> so that we can continue to support our friends in Ukraine and replenish our own stocks?\\\"<br>\",\"The Prime Minister's reply was, \\\"That is an excellent point. In a word, yes. That is why we have <br> invested £2.5 billion in rebuilding our stockpiles. Beyond the money, we do need to build our defence <br> industrial capability. That is a challenge shared across NATO that I have discussed extensively with <br> partners, including the NATO Secretary-General. Of course, part of our agreement with Ukraine is how <br> we can mutually help to support and grow our defence industrial complexes\\\".<br>\",\"Could someone---is it one for Mr Start?---please explain what the Prime Minister meant when he said <br> \\\"mutually help to support and grow our defence industrial complexes\\\"?<br>\",\"One of my roles is to lead a programme called Project Hirst, which is our project of supporting <br> Ukraine to build its defence industrial capability, its ability to domestically support the fight, while <br> working in conjunction with UK industry.<br>\",\"Using a combination of UK funds and UK Export Finance, we are in the process of supporting UK industry <br> to forum partnerships, joint ventures or other commercial arrangements with Ukrainian companies. <br> Together with Ukraine, we are building industrial capacity for the fight. There are some real benefits <br> to that.<br>\",\"In Ukraine?<br>\",\"It is building capability both here and in Ukraine. I was out in Kyiv just before Christmas running <br> the first of a series of conferences between the UK defence industry and the Ukrainian defence <br> industry. I was pleased to be joined by the Ukrainian Defence Minister and their Minister for strategic <br> supply, as we worked together to build up that capacity together.<br>\",\"I talked to you earlier on about the fact that in the fight some technologies are evolving every 90 <br> days. The benefit that our industry gets from working with the Ukrainian industry is that real <br> operational feedback into how its products are working and how it needs to adapt over time. That will make <br> us more competitive in export as well as ensuring that our products adapt and remain relevant in <br> the fight against Russia and others.<br>\",\"I totally get that in terms of the cutting edge, but not all of it is cutting edge, like NLAWs or <br> 155-millimetre shells. I understand that the Ukraine provision is being paid for from a separate pot, <br> in effect. However, it is still coming from the same factories. Is there enough to go around, even <br> if we can pay for it?<br>\",\"There is no question that industrial capacity across Europe is stretched, particularly in some areas <br> like 155-millimetre munitions. Over the last 12 months, as part of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, <br> I have been working with my national armament director colleagues to build that capacity in both <br> physical continental Europe and the US to increase industrial capacity.<br>\",\"An example of that in the UK was our investment in increasing the capacity of our 155-millimetre <br> munition manufacturing capability with BAE Systems, under our long-term partnering agreement with BAE <br> Systems. We have increased that capacity eightfold by investing in its underlying manufacturing capacity <br> to support both our need and the need for Ukraine.<br>\",\"As things stand, can the British public be satisfied that, if there was a war tomorrow, we would have <br> enough 155-millimetre shells?<br>\",\"In conjunction with our allies---we have pooled capacity in those critical munitions with allies---we <br> have enough capability to fight, if we needed to.<br>\",\"It is important to recognise that one of the reasons for that is that the adversary that is identified <br> as our highest threat is currently engaged in a war with Ukraine. That is attritting its capability. <br> Anything that we do to support Ukraine degrades our greatest potential adversary.<br>\",\"General Magowan, would you like to add to that?<br>\",\"Yes, a couple of things. First of all, we would have to have a closed session, understandably, on <br> where we hold risk in the so-called TSR---the total stockpile requirement---against the state-on-state <br> threat that Mr Start has been talking about. We are very happy to do that. Clearly, we would not <br> want to do that in public.<br>\",\"The second point I would make is that I hate to predict the future, but I do not think NATO would be <br> fighting in the way that the Ukrainians, unfortunately, are having to fight against the Russians in <br> their own country. It would be a different fight. There would be a different demand on 155. That is <br> all I would say at this point.<br>\",\"My role in Mr Start's plan is to ensure that, as much as possible, there is a commonality of operational <br> requirements between our requirements and Ukraine's because that adds to industrial <br> resilience.<br>\",\"Lastly, to answer your point directly about whether the British public should be confident that we <br> can produce these stockpiles, we should think of an exponential curve going that way. It is going to <br> take some time to ramp up from where we were five years ago to where we need to be. It is accelerating, <br> but it is going to take a number of years, in certain cases, to get to the level that we need to <br> reach against the total stockpile requirement for full warfighting.<br>\",\"Looking at it from the other side of the coin, from the manufacturers' point of view, they also need <br> confidence that, if they are going to build new plants, those are going to be used. From your <br> conversations with them, Mr Start, are they feeling confident about increasing their capability?<br>\",\"As per my conversation earlier on with Mrs Drummond, the industry is looking for a long-term commitment <br> from Government to help it underpin its investment strategy. Together with industry, we have <br> developed a munitions strategy that allows it to get the visibility that it needs. Our intent is to <br> underwrite that in the long-term plan, which then creates the ability for it to scale up capability to <br> meet the UK need.<br>\",\"To meet the Ukrainian need, we are working with it to provide as much visibility as we can about what <br> Ukraine needs and sharing that with our other allies to help create the stimulus where they can <br> invest. Certainly, in my conversations with chief execs, they are keen to invest, if we can give them <br> enough clarity and certainty, and we are working hard to do that.<br>\",\"The munitions strategy that Mr Start just mentioned was co-written between us and industry.<br>\",\"Does it become easier if, as the Prime Minister said, we are going to be working across NATO?<br>\",\"It is absolutely easier if we do it across NATO. We are doing that as far as is possible within the <br> current commitments under the Conference of National Armaments Directors, on which I sit.<br>\",\"We are keen to see the nations continue to work together to give a clear signal around their long-term <br> commitment to Ukraine over the next five years or so. The stronger we can make those commitments, <br> the easier it is for industry to make the investments it needs and to ramp up the capacity that we <br> would all like to see.<br>\",\"Permanent Secretary, if I may take you back to recruitment and retention, it is clearly a big problem <br> at the moment. You must be looking at different assessments and at the way in which you can review <br> what is going on and what the problems are at the core in the Department at the moment.<br>\",\"There are significant numbers of people leaving. When you are walking around the Department, you must <br> be looking at people and thinking, \\\"Why are they leaving?\\\"<br>\",\"There are a range of issues. I do not have with me the annual survey, AFCAS, but as part of that we <br> ask a series of questions about which aspects of service life are retention-positive and which are <br> retention-negative. We get quite a good feel from across the service population about the factors of <br> their experience and, within the Armed Forces, what drives people to stay or to go. That is published. <br> I would be happy to share it with the Committee, but I do not have it with me today.<br>\",\"There is a question around the wider economic situation. This is not an excuse, but we saw exit levels <br> drop off quite markedly during Covid. More people were staying than is usual. Some of the effect <br> that we are seeing is a correction of that period, but it is now stabilising at a level that is higher <br> than the historic norm.<br>\",\"From the answers we have been given today, a lot of the problems that people have been focusing on <br> are caused by issues of retention and recruitment. The findings of that report should probably be <br> imprinted at the forefront of your mind when walking around, making decisions and informing Ministers.<br>\",\"How far is your work to improve the number of senior responsible owners undermined by the inability <br> to provide them with supporting teams?<br>\",\"It is important to get the right support for SROs in terms of both the direct support that they get <br> from programme directors in their immediate teams and the wider support that they get from delivery <br> teams in Mr Start's organisation as well. That is part of the issue there.<br>\",\"As part of our work on the broader procurement model, the broader operating model, there are other <br> challenges for SROs around their direct control of projects in their programmes, which does not sit <br> neatly with the way in which money flows around the organisation in our current setup, and the range <br> of influence they have across all of the lines of development that go to make successful programme <br> delivery. That is one factor but only one factor.<br>\",\"We have made good progress over the past year in increasing the proportion of SRO time that is spent <br> on delivering programmes. We are now up at the 90% mark for SROs who are spending at least 50% of <br> their time on major programmes. Where it is lower, they will be dealing with programmes that are allied <br> or related capabilities. We are supporting them through training and accreditation, including of <br> their programme directors. It is a live issue, but one that we are taking steps to address.<br>\",\"Last week we learned that the Royal Navy's support arm was being forced to use Serco to recruit <br> deckhands. This is the first time in history that the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is not going to be directly <br> employing people on Navy and Royal Marines vessels. This is going to cost you more money and it is <br> not particularly conducive to keeping a good workforce in order either. This is not sustainable, is <br> it?<br>\",\"My understanding of that particular case is that we have a contract with Serco for certain port and <br> dockside capabilities. I do not think that job advert is indicative of the health of recruiting <br> potential in the RFA.<br>\",\"Just to be clear, Mr Williams, you are saying that the story was not accurate.<br>\",\"Yes, I think that is what I am saying.<br>\",\"Let us call a spade a spade. Let us be clear that we are not asking private companies to provide <br> people to serve on Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships.<br>\",\"Again, the Permanent Secretary referred to this at the beginning. One of the major recruitment <br> challenges is that we need to invoke greater flexibility in Armed Forces careers. We are in a different <br> environment to when I joined the Royal Marines, 525 years ago.<br>\",\"We are in a position where we have to offer zig-zag careers or whatever it might be. Again, we do <br> not have the report here, but quite often the reason people give for leaving is \\\"inability to manage <br> my own life\\\". That answer is more prevalent now than it was decades ago. We are getting after that. <br> That is what the Haythornthwaite review identified.<br>\",\"General, we are not alone in this challenge. There are reports of similar challenges with recruitment <br> in the US. You want the best of the best. You want to be able to serve alongside the best of the <br> best. In recent years, has there been too much emphasis on equality of output rather than equality of <br> opportunity in terms of recruitment?<br>\",\"Do you want to explain what you mean by that?<br>\",\"We have been looking at a more diverse range of people to go into the forces in particular, which is <br> on one hand a good thing. When that becomes the sole focus of a recruitment campaign, that does not <br> necessarily always yield results.<br>\",\"Let me bring it home to the Royal Marines. About four or five years ago, the Royal Marines, along <br> with the other frontline capability in the Armed Forces, welcomed women to join. Our view in the Royal <br> Marines is that a diverse team is a stronger team. There is quite a lot of evidence that a narrow <br> team can develop groupthink. Greater diversity, whatever it might be, whether it be gender or race, <br> delivers a stronger and more challenging team.<br>\",\"I would refute that it is a distraction. It is something we should absolutely be getting after. <br> History shows that it is a strength.<br>\",\"Finally, Mr Start, the report states that you have identified 20 roles where you do not have the <br> number of skilled staff you need, which included project managers, commercial staff, data scientists, <br> business analysts and engineers. These are all highly competitive roles. Why can we not keep them or <br> even recruit them?<br>\",\"We are able to recruit them. If we are focusing on the Civil Service, we are able to recruit them, <br> but we do have a slow and steady attrition of this skillset. Why do we have a slow and steady attrition? <br> It is because these are very attractive skills that are wanted in many industries that are <br> currently vibrant. There are very low levels of unemployment. There is a lot of competition for these <br> kinds of jobs. Fundamentally, we need more, coming out of our colleges and universities, to meet the <br> national demand. It is an overall supply and demand issue.<br>\",\"What are we doing about it? We are trying to be clear that, while other people may pay more in some <br> circumstances, we offer a competitive package that is a mixture of a good salary, a good pension and, <br> most importantly, work that is genuinely meaningful, rewarding and enjoyable. We are hoping that <br> message attracts more and more not just to DNS but to the wider defence industry, which is desperately <br> in need of more skills.<br>\",\"Mr Start, General Magowan said earlier that we need a much stronger industrial base and you have said <br> there is an assembly issue with some projects. We are seeing a decline in the UK manufacturing base <br> as a whole. We have heard the news about Port Talbot steelworks closing. What is the MoD doing to <br> secure the defence manufacturing sector in the future, particularly around bringing in skilled workers, <br> such as apprentices, welders and platers, to secure the supply chain in the future?<br>\",\"Defence overall has an underlying industrial strategy that articulates its aspiration and then breaks <br> that down into sector strategies covering each of the major areas of defence. In the shipbuilding <br> space, for example, we have the National Shipbuilding Office, which is trying to blend the needs of <br> UK military with the private sector.<br>\",\"We have done pretty well in shipbuilding. If you go back a decade, we had one plant that was actively <br> manufacturing defence warships for the nation. We now have three. Each of those is building in more <br> skills with skills academies that underpin them. Within that sector, there has been a really good <br> story.<br>\",\"There are challenges. For example, there are not enough master welders to teach the apprentices. That <br> creates a challenge for us. There is a rite of passage that you have to go through and learning <br> takes time, but we are trying to work that as actively as we can with industry to help stimulate it. <br> Where appropriate, Government have been doing their best to support them.<br>\",\"You say \\\"stimulate\\\". If it is a question of time, you cannot just rush people through the training <br> to become a master welder.<br>\",\"Yes. The dynamic is about working with them to create the academies, to encourage as many master <br> welders into the system as we can and to be flexible where necessary to bring capabilities from partners <br> and allies. For example, when we have managed to sell our design to an overseas shipyard, we work <br> collaboratively with that shipyard but also encourage them to bring skills and capabilities into the <br> UK and enhance our capabilities. That is what we have been doing in the maritime domain, which has <br> been quite strong.<br>\",\"In the land sector, we have the land industrial strategy. To be honest, we have seen a renaissance <br> in our capability from almost nothing in the UK, where we had seen it wither on the vine, to a capability <br> where we are now very active with the building of Boxer. There are multiple manufacturing plants <br> working on the Boxer programme. The Challenger 3 programme is very active and so on.<br>\",\"We are seeing good efforts. We are trying to work with industry through both our industrial strategy <br> and the Defence Suppliers Forum in order to have a coherent plan with industry. It is a big job of <br> work. The truth of the matter is that it is a challenging global environment. That is going to drive <br> overall increased spending in this sector, and therefore we have to build industrial capacity.<br>\",\"I know time is tight, but I would really welcome if you could write to the Committee and explain some <br> of those challenges, particularly the shortfalls around master welders and the very high-skilled <br> jobs in defence manufacturing that we are looking at, and how we are going to get through that.<br>\",\"It is an important pillar of defence strategy to have an industrial strategy. When you talked about <br> volatility earlier, Mr Start, there is volatility, but some of this is about long-term planning and <br> pipelines, which is of concern to us.<br>\",\"I have two very brief things to mop up. Mr Wipperman, on figure 14, further to the questions by Mr <br> Djanogly and Ms Owen on building manufacturing capacity, is that £5.01 billion a commitment in the <br> budget? The NAO Report says that the MoD \\\"intends\\\" to invest. Which is it? Is it a commitment or an <br> intention?<br>\",\"On figure 14, the £560 million is agreed funding from the Treasury. The £1.95 billion is agreed <br> funding from the Treasury. The £2.5 billion is a commitment that was made in the defence command paper <br> refresh in July, which we will invest into the future. That does not represent new funding; it represents <br> how we will reprioritise within the existing budget.<br>\",\"It will come out of the budget in due course.<br>\",\"Yes, that is right.<br>\",\"Over what timeframe?<br>\",\"We are already getting after munitions generally. We are working through that now and we would start <br> to see it in future plans. It might be next year; it might be the year after.<br>\",\"Just to put that in context, against that £560 million, over £400 million of it is already on contract. <br> Against the wider number, we have already spent over £1 billion on replenishment, which is already <br> on contract. A lot of this is underway and there is more to come.<br>\",\"I have another question for you, Mr Start. In the dreaded GMPP list of red projects---I am asking <br> this question carefully and no doubt you will want to answer it carefully---is there a problem with <br> complex digital communication systems across a range of defence equipment?<br>\",\"I am going to carefully answer the question by saying that is delivered within Defence Digital and <br> it would be unfair for me to comment. I will let David take the wider question.<br>\",\"There are a range of challenges, and we have had hearings before this Committee before on the digital <br> programme.<br>\",\"We had a whole set of sessions.<br>\",\"Some of the programmes that are particularly challenging are, in my view, at the more basic end of <br> our IT and digital infrastructure.<br>\",\"The basic end?<br>\",\"Let me take the example of the MODNet Evolve programme. We bent out of shape in order to support <br> hybrid and working from home during Covid. It is a programme that includes the delivery of laptops, for <br> instance. We did a really good job in supporting that.<br>\",\"As a result, some of the other elements of the programme around the management of printed services <br> and moving some of the secret domain to the cloud are taking longer than originally thought. This is <br> not the most technical end, but it is fundamental underpinning infrastructure that has been disrupted <br> through real-world events.<br>\",\"I wonder whether you are putting a bit of a gloss on that. Let me give you another example. Morpheus <br> does involve complex digital communications. It is not the only one. There are others with complex <br> digital communications.<br>\",\"On digital transformation programmes generally, we are not alone in Government in this.<br>\",\"We have covered this. Just to be clear, we have done a separate report on this. You can keep your <br> answer brief. We do not need to revisit it.<br>\",\"Yes, there is a challenge. Some of the ones that are red are not at the most challenging end of the <br> spectrum. That is all I meant.<br>\",\"They are not the most challenging.<br>\",\"Not all of them, no.<br>\",\"We have an interesting challenge here, if I can put it politely, with the equipment plan. If we look <br> back to last year, there was a £4.3 billion contingency in the plan and the worst-case deficit was <br> just over £7 billion. If you add those two together, it does not even hit the size of £17 billion. <br> It is not enough to close the gap, yet you have been quite buoyant today, as a team. Mr Williams, why <br> are you so buoyant that you can manage this?<br>\",\"The Defence Secretary gave a speech this time last week around the challenges in the international <br> environment. I am loath to feel buoyant about that. Those are very real and present threats.<br>\",\"Against the Government's commitment---although the timeframe is to be decided---that defence spending <br> should increase over time, and against the headmark in capability terms around the exploitation of <br> technology and the changes to our procurement system that we have pointed the way for in the defence <br> command paper refresh last summer, we have a pretty clear idea of where we need to get to and a <br> reasonable chance of having the wherewithal to get there.<br>\",\"Is it a challenging environment? Yes, absolutely. Based on the set of assumptions that we had when <br> this snapshot plan was produced last year, there are a range of affordability challenges that we need <br> to deal with, but we have work in hand to think about our priorities. We are making the case for <br> our budget.<br>\",\"I just need to pick up on that. You are making a case, but you are waiting for the spending review <br> as a major part of achieving this, and there is this assumption that you are going to get 2.5% of GDP <br> for defence spending. You sound very optimistic that those two elements will be part of it, but yet <br> we have not really had any discussion about reducing capability in order to meet the demands of the <br> overall programme.<br>\",\"We are working through what we need to do next year and maybe the year after to get us to the spending <br> review. My point is simply that deliberately taking things out of the programme against an <br> expectation and a Government policy that the budget will go up is not good value for money or a sensible <br> set of decisions to take from a capability perspective. It is about managing that uncertainty over <br> the next 18 months.<br>\",\"If you do not get the money, you are going to have to take capability out, are you not?<br>\",\"Yes, but then a spending review is the proper process by which to have conversations with the Prime <br> Minister and the Chancellor about how much is being invested in defence and what they get back for <br> that investment.<br>\",\"We can go round and round on this. As I said at the beginning, it is a bit like groundhog day. The <br> capability needs and the budget never seem to balance. We have gone over it a lot. We will revisit it <br> again next year, whatever iteration of this Committee there is at that point. If it is in a year's <br> time, there will have been a general election in between.
