April 1694 a French official in the town of Beauvais described the impact\\nof famine and of soaring food prices, saying that his entire district was now filled with ‘an infinite\\nnumber of poor souls, weak from hunger and wretchedness and dying from want, because, having no\\nwork or occupation, they lack the money to buy bread.\",\"Half of humankind is expected to be overweight by 2030.4 In 2010 famine and malnutrition combined\\nkilled about 1 million people, whereas obesity killed 3 million.5\",\"Since 1974 hundreds of\\nmillions of Chinese have been lifted out of poverty, and though hundreds of millions more still suffer\\ngreatly from privation and malnutrition, for the first time in its recorded history China is now free\\nfrom famine.\",\"Though hundreds of millions still go hungry\\nalmost every day, in most countries very few people actually starve to death.\",\"Indeed, in most countries today overeating has become a far worse problem than famine.\",\"Between 75 million and 200 million people died – more than a quarter of the population of Eurasia.\",\"In England, four out of ten people died, and the population dropped from a pre-plague high of 3.7\\nmillion people to a post-plague low of 2.2 million.\",\"People consequently lived their lives in\\nancient Athens or medieval Florence knowing that they might fall ill and die next week, or that an\\nepidemic might suddenly erupt and destroy their entire family in one swoop.\",\"After famine, humanity’s second great enemy was plagues and infectious diseases.\",\"From there, riding on an army of rats and fleas, the plague quickly spread all over Asia,\\nEurope and North Africa, taking less than twenty years to reach the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.\",\"When in 1913 people said that there was peace between France and Germany, they meant that ‘there\\nis no war going on at present between France and Germany, but who knows what next year will\\nbring’.\",\"When today we say that there is peace between France and Germany, we mean that it is\\ninconceivable under any foreseeable circumstances that war might break out between them.\",\"Today we think about peace as the implausibility of war.\",\"Nuclear\\nweapons have turned war between superpowers into a mad act of collective suicide, and therefore\\nforced the most powerful nations on earth to find alternative and peaceful ways to resolve conflicts.\",\"Just as nuclear\\nweapons made the New Peace possible in the first place, so future technological developments might\\nset the stage for new kinds of war.\",\"Struggling against\\nold age and death will merely carry on the time-honoured fight against famine and disease, and\\nmanifest the supreme value of contemporary culture: the worth of human life.\",\"Humans died because God decreed it, and their\\nmoment of death was a sacred metaphysical experience exploding with meaning.\",\"Since death clearly violates this right, death is a crime against humanity, and\\nwe ought to wage total war against it.\",\"Humans always die due to some technical glitch.\",\"The Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights adopted by the UN after the Second World War – which is perhaps the\\nclosest thing we have to a global constitution – categorically states that ‘the right to life’ is humanity’s\\nmost fundamental value.\",\"Once stem-cell\\nresearch enables us to create an unlimited supply of human embryos on the cheap, you can select your\\noptimal baby from among hundreds of candidates, all carrying your DNA, all perfectly natural, and\\nnone requiring any futuristic genetic engineering.\",\"All people carry\\nin their DNA some harmful mutations and less-than-optimal alleles.\",\"The baby’s nuclear\\nDNA comes from two parents, while the mitochondrial DNA comes from a third person.\",\"So they perform in vitro fertilisation, and test the DNA of the\\nfertilised egg.\",\"A year\\nlater, in 2001, the US government banned this treatment, due to safety and ethical concerns.48\\n   However, on 3 February 2015 the British Parliament voted in favour of the so-called ‘three-parent\\nembryo’ law, allowing this treatment – and related research – in the UK.49 At present it is technically\\nunfeasible, and illegal, to replace nuclear DNA, but if and when the technical difficulties are solved,\\nthe same logic that favoured the replacement of defective mitochondrial DNA would seem to warrant\\ndoing the same with nuclear DNA.\",\"The prediction that in the twenty-first century humankind is likely to aim for immortality, bliss and\\ndivinity may anger, alienate or frighten any number of people, so a few clarifications are in order.\",\"Based on these insights he predicted an increasingly violent conflict\\nbetween the proletariat and the capitalists, ending with the inevitable victory of the former and the\\ncollapse of the capitalist system.\",\"Centuries ago human knowledge increased slowly, so politics and economics changed at a\\nleisurely pace too.\",\"My prediction is focused on what humankind will try to achieve in\\nthe twenty-first century – not what it will succeed in achieving.\",\"As a result, Marx’s predictions came to naught.\",\"Movements seeking to change the world often begin by rewriting history, thereby enabling people\\nto reimagine the future.\",\"If history doesn’t follow any stable rules, and if we cannot predict its future course, why study it?\",\"Studying history aims to loosen the grip of the past.\",\"Grass is\\nnowadays the most widespread crop in the USA after maize and wheat, and the lawn industry (plants,\\nmanure, mowers, sprinklers, gardeners) accounts for billions of dollars every year.51\",\"Humans thereby came to identify lawns with political power, social status and economic wealth.\",\"No investigation of our divine future can ignore\\nour own animal past, or our relations with other animals – because the relationship between humans\\nand animals is the best model we have for future relations between superhumans and humans.\",\"Due to an uncompromising\\nhumanist belief in the sanctity of human life, we keep people alive till they reach such a pitiful state\\nthat we are forced to ask, ‘What exactly is so sacred here?’ Due to similar humanist beliefs, in the\\ntwenty-first century we are likely to push humankind as a whole beyond its limits.\",\"How did Homo sapiens come to believe in the humanist creed, according to which the universe\\nrevolves around humankind and humans are the source of all meaning and authority?\",\"The same\\ntechnologies that can upgrade humans into gods might also make humans irrelevant.\",\"While the\\nattempt to upgrade humans into gods takes humanism to its logical conclusion, it simultaneously\\nexposes humanism’s inherent flaws.\"],[0.0412346842882427,0.0412051799524393,0.0380041593772913,0.0336848942025152,0.0324251747326398,0.17731631402826,0.174444636524036,0.155129968564267,0.15198829728128,0.135211239589934,0.0389791223842984,0.0384144252134799,0.0376756231431434,0.0373632091487523,0.0371767108904067,0.0539073132243805,0.0511840985387847,0.0496959570056606,0.0423335397592561,0.0415196807447105,0.0221349116890239,0.0185030841949107,0.0181753341631641,0.0180176651375693,0.0178596953068549,0.0326020954083341,0.028675416584137,0.0284809183948437,0.02845347066155,0.0279320785079953,0.0288943384953153,0.0286965726082904,0.02651426332322,0.0244217063968325,0.0241899994770758,0.0343734049722982,0.0337989648595471,0.0323402917203859,0.0322724736167244,0.0316286538716593]],\"container\":\"<table
