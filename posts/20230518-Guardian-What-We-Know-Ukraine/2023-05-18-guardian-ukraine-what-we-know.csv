 <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s president <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/15/volodymyr-zelenskiy-to-meet-rishi-sunak-in-london-on-monday"">visited the UK on Monday</a> for talks with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak.</strong> In a tweet, <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong> said: “The UK is a leader when it comes to expanding our capabilities on the ground and in the air. This cooperation will continue today. I will meet my friend Rishi. We will conduct substantive negotiations face to face and in delegations.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Sunak </strong><strong>said the UK </strong><strong>would be “sustaining our support” for Ukraine as he prepare</strong><strong>d to meet </strong><strong>Zelenskiy.</strong> In a statement, the prime minister said: “This is a crucial moment in Ukraine’s resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke. They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year. We must not let them down.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Britain </strong><strong>would send hundreds of new long-range attack drones with a range of over </strong><strong>120 miles to Ukraine, the government said.</strong> “Today the prime minister will confirm the further UK provision of hundreds of air defence missiles and further unmanned aerial systems including hundreds of new long-range attack drones with a range of over 200km,” it said in a statement.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>Russia</strong>’s defence ministry claimed for the first time today that it had downed a long-range Storm Shadow missile supplied to <strong>Ukraine</strong> by <strong>Britain</strong>.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russia</strong> took an “extremely negative” view of <strong>Britain</strong>’s decision to supply <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> with more military hardware such as long-range attack drones, but did not believe it would change the course of the conflict, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Monday.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The U</strong><strong>S is seeing more indications that Russia and Iran are expanding an unprecedented defence partnership that will help Moscow prolong its war in Ukraine as well as pose a threat to Iran’s neighbours.</strong> Iran reportedly provided Russia with one-way attack drones, including more than 400 since August, the US national security adviser, John Kirby, said at a news briefing.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The World Health Organization’s European office decided to close a specialised WHO office in Moscow and move its functions to Denmark.</strong> Calls from members to shut the office came last year over the Russian invasion.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, inadvertently confirmed on Monday that four military aircraft had been shot down over Russia last week near the borders of Ukraine and Belarus</strong>, saying the capital city, Minsk, had responded by putting its armed forces on high alert. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/15/images-of-lukashenko-released-after-rumours-over-belarusian-leaders-health"">Photographs also emerged of Lukashenko</a> on Monday visiting an air force installation. He had not been seen since 9 May, which caused speculation about his health.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Data published on the Federal Treasury’s online budget portal shows Russia spent 2tn roubles (£21bn) on defence in January and February alone.</strong> This is a 282% jump on the same period a year ago, data on the budget portal showed, illustrating the spiralling costs for Moscow of its conflict in Ukraine.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russia’s defence ministry said it scrambled a fighter jet </strong><strong>on Monday to prevent French and German patrol aircraft from entering its airspace over the Baltic Sea</strong> after it detected them flying towards Russia. Russia said the flights were being conducted by a German P-3C patrol aircraft and a French Atlantic-2 maritime patrol jet.</p></li> 
</ul>

 <li><p><strong>The UN aid chief, Martin Griffiths, said </strong><strong>that efforts </strong><strong>would continue to extend a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of Ukraine grain,</strong> a pact Moscow has threatened to quit on 18 May over obstacles to its grain and fertiliser exports, Reuters reports.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy issued a new appeal to Nato</strong> on Monday to make a “positive political decision” on Kyiv’s membership at its July summit. Zelenskiy made his remarks in a video address to the Copenhagen Democracy Summit. He said that Finland joining Nato showed the strength of security guarantees, and thanked Denmark and other allies for their resolve in assisting Ukraine against Russia.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The defence of Bakhmut</strong> continued and recent days had shown that Ukraine could move forward and counter the Russian forces there, the commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Monday.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Yevgeny Prigozhin</strong>, the self-acknowledged founder of the Russian mercenary Wagner group, tried to laugh off a report published in the Washington Post that claimed he had offered to reveal Russian military positions to Ukrainian intelligence if Kyiv pulled its troops back from Bakhmut.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The EU is ready to enforce sanctions against foreign companies helping Russia evade trade restrictions, the head of the European Commission, <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong>, reiterated on Monday.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Nato</strong>’s secretary general, <strong>Jens Stoltenberg</strong>, has said he expects the alliance to agree a “multi-year programme” to assist Ukraine in its desire to join, and that there was no “meaning in discussing when and how Ukraine can become a member of the alliance” unless it prevailed in the war “as a sovereign independent nation in Europe”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>France at the weekend announced dozens more light tanks and armoured vehicles for Ukraine’s army</strong>, together with training for the soldiers using them, following talks between the Ukrainian and French presidents in Paris. Zelenskiy and Emmanuel Macron also called for fresh sanctions against Russia. The leaders’ joint statement also said Paris would focus its efforts on “supporting Ukraine’s air defence capacities”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The two leaders’ comments came after Zelenskiy flew into France late on Sunday during a whistle-stop tour of Europe</strong> and joined Macron for a dinner at the Élysée Palace. Zelenskiy tweeted earlier as he arrived in the country at an airbase in Villacoublay, south-west of Paris: “With each visit, Ukraine’s defense and offensive capabilities are expanding.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/14/ukraine-can-defeat-russia-by-end-of-year-with-western-help-zelenskiy-says"">Zelenskiy thanked Germany for its support</a> and what he called the largest military aid package since the beginning of Russia’s invasion</strong> as he met with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in Berlin on Sunday. The trip came after the German government announced a new military package worth €2.7bn as Ukrainian forces prepare for a counteroffensive to reclaim territory captured by Russia.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>During Zelenskiy’s visit to Germany, he was awarded the prestigious Charlemagne prize on behalf of the Ukrainian people in honour of services to Europe. </strong>The Ukrainian president received the award, which honours services to European unification, in the western city of Aachen with Scholz after their talks in Berlin.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The German Football Association (DFB) vice-president, <strong>Hermann Winkler</strong>, on Monday <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/15/germany-fa-vice-president-apologises-for-post-mocking-volodymyr-zelenskiy"">apologised for a social media</a> post mocking the visit to Berlin.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russia </strong><strong>said two of its military commanders were killed in eastern Ukraine</strong>, as Ukraine’s forces renewed efforts to break through Russian defences in embattled Bakhmut. The Russian defence ministry said on Sunday that commander Vyacheslav Makarov, of the 4th motorised rifle brigade, and deputy commander Yevgeny Brovko, from a separate unit, were killed trying to repel Ukrainian attacks.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russia has “already lost geopolitically” its war in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> and is transforming into a vassal state of China, Macron has said. </strong>“De facto, it has entered a form of subservience with regards to China and has lost its access to the Baltic, which was critical, because it prompted the decision by Sweden and Finland to join Nato,” the French president said in an interview with the Opinion newspaper published on Sunday.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russian forces </strong><strong>were much diminished since the start of the war</strong>, the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-arrives-in-berlin-after-germany-announces-further-27bn-of-military-aid?page=with:block-64609f6a8f08c4e696f28f69#block-64609f6a8f08c4e696f28f69"">UK Ministry of Defence said</a>, with troops consisting of mostly poorly trained mobilised reservists and increasingly reliant on antiquated equipment.

 <li><p><strong>Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Russia’s Wagner group mercenary force, said on Friday that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/05/wagner-chief-yevgeny-prigozhin-rages-at-russia-generals-and-threatens-bakhmut-pullout"">his forces would leave the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut</a> that they have been trying to capture since last summer. </strong>Prigozhin said they would pull back on 10 May – ending their involvement in the longest and bloodiest battle of the war – because of heavy losses and inadequate ammunition supplies. He asked defence chiefs to insert regular army troops in their place.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Earlier Prigozhin released a video showing him standing in a field of Russian corpses, personally blaming top defence chiefs for the losses suffered by his fighters in Ukraine. </strong>Prigozhin’s expletives were bleeped out in the video published by his press service, in which he yelled “We have a 70% shortage of ammunition. Shoigu! Gerasimov! Where is the ******* ammunition?”. The reference to defence minister Sergei Shoigu and chief of general staff Valery Gerasimov appeared to reignite the simmering feud between Prigozhin and the Russian establishment forces.</p></li> 
 <li><p>In a coded response, defence minister <strong>Sergei Shoigu</strong> has carried out an inspection of troop readiness for forces that are engaged in the war against Ukraine.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Authorities in the Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia have begun evacuating villages near the frontline. </strong>The Russian imposed governor <strong>Yevgeny Balitsky</strong> announced the move in anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive aimed at retaking the area. It is believed that about 70,000 civilians could be taken away from the area.</p></li> 
 <li><p>“In the past few days, the enemy has stepped up shelling of settlements close to the frontline,” <strong>Balitsky</strong> said. “I have therefore made a decision to evacuate first of all children and parents, elderly people, disabled people and hospital patients.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>It is believed that Russia is bringing Wagner forces from along the frontline to Bakhmut, </strong>according to Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar. She said that Russia wanted to capture the city before the victory day holiday on 9 May.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Residents in Kherson are readying themselves ahead of a 56-hour curfew <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/04/ukraine-residents-kherson-prepare-for-curfew-after-night-of-heavy-shelling"">due to begin on Friday evening.</a></strong> The violence in the oblast has intensified this week, with 23 people killed by Russian strikes on Wednesday.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s air force said it downed one of its own drones after it lost control over Kyiv</strong> on Thursday. Andriy Yermak, Ukraine presidential chief of staff, initially said an enemy drone that had been shot down. But the air force later clarified it was Ukrainian and had been destroyed to avoid “undesirable circumstances”. No casualties were reported.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that the Ilsky oil refinery in the <strong>Krasnodar</strong> region of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"">Russia</a> has been attacked by a drone or drones for the second consecutive day.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Russia’s foreign minister <strong>Sergei Lavrov</strong> has said “any self-respecting country” would refrain from speaking to Ukraine’s President <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy"">Volodymyr Zelenskiy</a> following the apparent drone attack on the Kremlin.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The White House has dismissed as “ludicrous” claims by Russia that Washington orchestrated drone strikes on Moscow,</strong> saying the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/04/russia-accuses-us-of-being-behind-drone-attack-on-kremlin-putin"">US was not involved in the incident</a> and accusing Russia of lying. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said: “One thing I can tell you for certain is that the US did not have any involvement with this incident, contrary to [Vladimir Putin spokesman] Mr Peskov’s lies, and that’s just what they are: lies.” Earlier, <strong>Dmitry Peskov</strong> said: “Decisions about such terrorist attacks are taken in Washington” and that Kyiv “just implements these decisions”.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Finnish power utility <strong>Fortum</strong> has formally notified the Kremlin that it strongly objects to what it said was Russia’s “unlawful” seizure of its subsidiary in the country. In his regular morning press conference, Kremlin spokesperson<strong> Peskov</strong> responded by saying the seizure was in accordance with Russian legislation.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Bill Clinton</strong> has said that he knew in 2011 it was just “a matter of time” before Vladimir Putin attacked Ukraine. “Vladimir Putin told me in 2011 — three years before he took Crimea — that he did not agree with the agreement I made with Boris Yeltsin,” the former US president recalled. “He said . . . ‘I don’t agree with it.

 <li><p><strong>Video footage has emerged overnight of a scuffle between a Ukrainian delegate and a Russian delegate during a gathering of Black Sea nations in the Turkish capital Ankara.</strong> The footage shows the Russian delegations secretary, <strong>Valery Stavitsky</strong>, snatching a Ukrainian flag out of the hands of his Ukrainian counterpart, <strong>Oleksandr Marikovski</strong>, who unfurled the flag behind another Russian delegate who was mid-interview at the parliamentary assembly of the Black Sea economic cooperation group in Turkey.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said Tuesday his country was inflicting heavy blows to Ukraine across the entire frontline </strong>but the supply of weapons was crucial to success.

 <li><p><strong>In today’s attack on Pavlohrad, in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, seven missiles were fired at the city, Serhii Lysak, the region’s top official, said. </strong>“Some were intercepted” but others hit an industrial facility, sparking a fire, and a residential neighbourhood where 19 apartment buildings, 25 homes, six schools and five shops were damaged, he said. Missiles also hit three other areas in the region, damaging residential buildings and a school, he said.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Video posted on social media showed secondary detonations amid a significant blaze at the site of the strike</strong>, which came amid overnight missile launches against a number of Ukrainian cities by Russian strategic bombers. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed were an industrial zone, 19 apartment buildings and 25 homes, according to Mykola Lukashuk, the head of the Dnipro region council.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The Ukrainian military reported that air defence crews had destroyed 15 out of 18 missiles launched by Russian forces in the early hours of Monday morning</strong> with air raids sirens and air defence batteries audible in Kyiv and across the country.</p></li>

 <li><p>The governor of <strong>Chernihiv</strong>, <strong>Viacheslav Chaus</strong>, has reported the death of a child in <strong>Novhorod-Siverskyi</strong> after a mid-afternoon strike on the region.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Russian media reported on Monday what looks like two separate overnight incidents of sabotage within the Russian Federation. <strong>Alexander Bogomaz</strong>, governor of <strong>Bryansk</strong>, said a freight train was derailed as a result of an explosive device blowing up on railway tracks in the region. <strong>Aleksandr Drozdenko</strong>, governor of <strong>Leningrad</strong> region, claimed that a power transmission line support was blown up there. He wrote that an explosive device was also found on a second power pylon, but that electricity supplies had not been disrupted.

 <li><p><strong>Vladimir Rogov</strong>, chair of the We Are Together with Russia organisation that operates within the occupied <strong>Zaporizhzhia</strong> region of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a>, has posted to Telegram to claim that a man has been killed by his own improvised explosives in occupied <strong>Melitopol</strong>.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Poland</strong>’s ministry of foreign affairs has issued a statement condemning the former children’s ombudsman of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"">Russia</a>, <strong>Pavel Astakhov</strong>, for comments he made on Russian state TV that murdering ambassadors is “within the framework of international law”, with specific reference to Poland’s ambassador. Poland called on Russia “to ensure the safety of all diplomats in accordance with the Vienna Convention”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>In Washington, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy emphatically stressed his support for military aid to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> on Monday, blistering Russia’s “killing of the children” and distancing himself from some in his party who oppose additional major US aid to stave off the Russian invasion. </strong>In Israel on his first trip abroad as speaker, McCarthy flatly rejected a suggestion at a news conference that he does not support sending military and financial aid to Ukraine – and he amplified his positions on other issues back home, including his demand for debt limit negotiations with President Joe Biden.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong> has spoken to New Zealand’s prime minister, <strong>Chris Hipkins</strong>. Ukraine’s president said the pair discussed “further cooperation on defence and humanitarian issues” and “the need for further consolidation of the countries of the Pacific region in supporting Ukraine.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has warned that an <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/30/ukraine-primed-for-crucial-offensive"">expected Ukrainian counteroffensive</a> could turn into a “tragedy” for Russia, and complained that his fighters lacked ammunition</strong>, in an interview with pro-Kremlin war correspondent Semyon Pegov. Prigozhin, whose group is spearheading Russia’s attack on the embattled city of Bakhmut, predicted a Ukrainian counterattack in mid-May and said Wagner had <strong>“</strong>only 10-15% of the shells that we need.”</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>The Russian army replaced its highest ranking general in charge of logistics, after days of rumours about the sacking of Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev</strong>. In a statement, the Russian defence ministry said Alexei Kuzmenkov – a former official from the National Guard – had replaced Mizintsev as “deputy defence minister of the Russian Federation, responsible for the logistical support of the Armed Forces.” The statement did not say why Mizintsev was replaced after just seven months in the job.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Four people have been killed from an overnight Ukrainian strike on the Russian border village of Suzemka</strong>, the governor of Russia’s western Bryansk region said on Sunday. “Two more civilians have been found and removed from the rubble.

Yuriy Sobolevskiy</strong>, deputy head of the Kherson regional administration, said the raids were intended to reduce the combat capability of Russian troops who have been shelling Kherson city since being forced to retreat. “Our military visit the left (eastern) bank very often, conducting raids. The Ukrainian armed forces are working, and working very effectively,” Sobolevskiy told Ukrainian television.</p></li> <li><p><strong>One person has been killed and ten wounded in a strike on a museum in Kupyansk in Kharkiv region.</strong> Ukraine’s President <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong> said “The terrorist country is doing everything to destroy us completely. Our history, our culture, our people. Killing Ukrainians with absolutely barbaric methods.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Oleh Synyehubov</strong>, governor of <strong>Kharkiv</strong>, said “Rescue operations are ongoing at the site of the rocket attack in the center of Kupyansk. Unfortunately, the woman who was under the rubble died. Rescuers have just recovered her body. According to our information, one more person may be under the rubble. Special services are doing everything possible to find her. There are no military facilities near the museum building, which was hit by an enemy S-300 missile. The enemy is deliberately hitting civilian infrastructure and terrorizing the civilian population.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>The number of daily casualties Russia is suffering has fallen by about 30% in April, UK intelligence has said. </strong>In its daily intelligence briefing, the Ministry of Defence reported that the drop was probably due to the end of Russia’s winter offensive, which, it added, had largely failed.

He pledged continued military support for Ukraine, saying that, so far, Nato allies had trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops and provided €65bn ($71.31bn) of military aid alone. “Nato stands with you today, tomorrow and for as long as it takes,” Stoltenberg stated, before inviting <strong>Vladmir Zelenskiy</strong> to the Nato summit in Vilnius in July.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy</strong> said <strong>Nato</strong> needs to invite <strong>Ukraine</strong> to become a member and give it a timeframe for accession. “I am grateful for the invitation to visit the summit, but it is also important for Ukraine to receive the corresponding invitation,” he told reporters. “There is not a single objective barrier to the political decision to invite Ukraine into the alliance and now, when most people in Nato countries and the majority of Ukrainians support Nato accession, is the time for the corresponding decisions.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Sergei Lavrov</strong>, Russia’s longtime foreign minister, will meet the <strong>UN</strong> secretary general <strong>António Guterres</strong> on Monday, according to Russia’s ambassador to the UN.

Denmark’s acting defence minister <strong>Troels Lund Poulsen</strong> said they are not Danish tanks, but tanks “which are bought in collaboration with the Netherlands”. Foreign minister <strong>Lars Løkke Rasmussen </strong>described it as “a very significant contribution”.</p></li> <li><p>Russian state-owned news agency Tass has cited <strong>Ismini Palla</strong>, spokesperson for the UN office at the joint coordination centre for the deal in Istanbul, saying that “inspections of vessels under the grain deal resumed on 19 April and are scheduled for 20 April”.</p></li> <li><p>The Donetsk People’s Republic, the Russian-imposed authority in Ukraine’s occupied Donetsk region, has claimed that overnight a woman has been killed in the city of <strong>Donetsk</strong> by shelling from Ukrainian armed forces.</p></li> <li><p>The <strong>Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant</strong> in southern Ukraine which Russia captured last year will stop using US-produced nuclear fuel as quickly as possible, the Interfax news agency quoted a Russian official as saying.</p></li> <li><p>The admiral of Russia’s <strong>Pacific fleet</strong> has left his position after a check of its combat readiness.

 <li><p><strong>Poland and Ukraine will resume negotiations early on Tuesday to try to reopen the transit of food and grains, the Polish agriculture minister told public radio station PR1. </strong>The two countries held talks on Monday over bans by central eastern European countries seeking to shelter their farmers from the impact of an influx of cheaper Ukrainian grain.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Romania’s</strong> ruling Social Democrat party (PSD) has said it will ask the coalition government to approve an emergency decree enforcing a temporary ban on Ukrainian grain imports, mirroring similar moves by countries in central and eastern Europe.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Russia’s defence minister, <strong>Sergei Shoigu</strong>, told his Chinese counterpart on Tuesday that their countries’ military cooperation was a “stabilising” force in the world and helped to reduce the chances of conflict.</p></li>

He had then been told he would be charged with thwarting prison authorities, which carries a maximum sentence of five years, Kobzev said.</p></li>

He was later also charged with “high treason” over a series of public speeches he made that criticised Kremlin policies and the war in Ukraine. Kara-Murza’s ruling is the longest sentence yet given to a political opponent of Vladimir Putin, as the Kremlin further steps up its relentless crackdown on dissent.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The British government on Monday summoned the Russian ambassador to make clear its condemnation of what it described as the “politically motivated” conviction of Kara-Murza, a British dual national. </strong>“Russia’s lack of commitment to protecting fundamental human rights, including freedom of expression, is alarming,” British foreign secretary James Cleverly said in a statement. “We continue to urge Russia to adhere to its international obligations including Vladimir Kara-Murza’s entitlement to proper healthcare.”</p></li> <li><p>The United Nations human rights chief <strong>Volker Türk</strong> has called on Moscow to free <strong>Kara-Murza</strong>, saying “No one should be deprived of their liberty for exercising their human rights, and I call on the Russian authorities to release him without delay.

A voice says: “They killed them. Someone came up to them. They came up to them and cut their heads off”. A second clip, which may have been filmed in summer last year, judging by the appearance of foliage in the clip, claims to show a member of Russian forces using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. The Guardian has not independently verified the origins and veracity of the two videos, but Ukrainian authorities are treating them as genuine.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Kremlin has described a video of Russian soldiers apparently beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war lying on the ground as “awful”, but questioned the video’s authenticity.</strong></p></li> <li><p><strong>Serbia, one of the only countries in Europe that has refused to sanction Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, agreed to supply arms to Kyiv or has sent them already, according to a classified Pentagon document. </strong>The document, a summary of European governments’ responses to Ukraine’s requests for military training and “lethal aid” or weapons, was among dozens of classified documents posted online in recent weeks in what could be the most serious leak of US secrets in years.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The UK government has imposed sanctions on the “financial fixers” who have allegedly helped Russian oligarchs Roman Abramovich and Alisher Usmanov hide their assets. </strong>The new sanctions, unveiled by the Foreign Office on Wednesday, are targeted at what officials describe as “oligarch enablers” whom they accuse of knowingly assisting the billionaire businessmen to shield their wealth.</p></li> <li><p><strong>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday said the United States will investigate the leak until the source is found. </strong>“We will continue to investigate and turn over every rock until we find the source of this and the extent of it,” Austin said during a press conference at the state department.</p></li> <li><p><strong>US intelligence reportedly warned Ukraine in February that it might fail to amass sufficient troops</strong> and weaponry for its planned spring counter-offensive, and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/11/us-ukraine-counter-offensive-pentagon-leaks-reveal"">might fall “well short”</a> of Kyiv’s goals for recapturing territory seized by Russia, according to a trove of leaked defence documents.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The same leaked US military documents indicate that the UK has deployed as many as 50 special forces to Ukraine.</strong> The documents suggest that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/11/up-to-50-uk-special-forces-present-in-ukraine-this-year-us-leak-suggests"">more than half of the western special forces</a> personnel present in Ukraine between February and March this year may have been British.

We will act in accordance with our own internal needs, norms and laws that apply in this situation, and nothing more,” Tass quoted Ryabkov as saying.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Kremlin has said the outlook for the Black Sea grain deal was “not so great”</strong>, claiming that promises to remove obstacles to Russian exports of agricultural and fertiliser exports had not been fulfilled. On Tuesday no vessels were cleared to travel using the grain initiative, after Russia scrubbed out the names of three ships, submitted by the Ukrainian side, as they returned home. Ukraine’s deputy infrastructure minister for seaports and maritime, <strong>Yurii Vaskov,</strong> described the situation as “critical”. If the standoff continues, global food prices are likely to go up by 15%, he said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>South Korea has agreed to “lend” the US 500,000 rounds of artillery, </strong>a newspaper reported on Wednesday, as Seoul attempts to minimise the possibility that the ammunition could end up in Ukraine - a move that could spark domestic criticism of President <strong>Yoon Suk Yeol.</strong> Citing unidentified government sources, the Dong-A Ilbo said South Korea had decided to lend the shells rather than sell them - an approach it believes would lower the likelihood of them eventually being supplied to Kyiv.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Protests by European farmers are political and shipments of Ukrainian grain are not reducing the profitability of their business, Ukrainian food producers’ union UAC claimed on Wednesday. </strong>Poland last week said it would temporarily halt Ukrainian grain imports after farmers’ protests led Poland’s agriculture minister to resign, but transit would still be allowed. “The political nature of the European farmers’ strikes is obvious. Ukraine sells some grain to Poland, and this is not a massive amount,” <strong>Denys Marchuk</strong>, deputy chair of the Ukrainian agrarian council (UAC), said in a statement. “However, certain forces need to demonstrate that this is due to an oversupply of Ukrainian grain,” he said, noting that the country faced elections later this year.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine has asked India for additional medicines and medical equipment, the South Asian country’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday. </strong>The request came during the three-day visit to India by Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister <strong>Emine Dzhaparova</strong>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia’s upper house of parliament has voted to introduce electronic call-up papers via an online portal for the first time. </strong>The Federation Council’s vote came a day after the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, gave its approval to changes in the law.

 <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has visited frontline military positions near the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut. </strong>During his visit, Zelenskiy heard “reports on the operational situation and the course of hostilities on the frontline”, an official statement said. He was also pictured meeting Ukrainian servicemen, and held a moment of silence in memory of those who had fallen in the war.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>At least six people have been killed overnight in a drone attack on </strong><strong>Rzhyshchiv</strong><strong> in the Kyiv region</strong>. The strike is reported to have hit a dormitory building and a school. The body of a 40-year-old man was pulled from the rubble on one floor, according to its regional police chief, adding that more than 20 people were taken to hospital. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, is reporting that one of the people who died was “an ambulance driver who came to the call”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>At least one person has been killed and 33 wounded by a twin Russian missile strike on two residential buildings in Zaporizhzhia,</strong> officials in Ukraine have said. Footage from a security camera captured the moment the strike hit, causing an explosion and a large plume of smoke to rise from two nine-storey buildings.</p></li>

 <li><p>The US ambassador to Ukraine, <strong>Bridget </strong><strong>Brink</strong>, tweeted in reaction to the attack: “After all the talk in Moscow yesterday [between Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping], more Russian missiles and more drone attacks on civilians overnight make it perfectly clear how much interest President Putin has in a just peace or an end to the war he started.”</p></li> 
 <li><p>Russia’s missile attack on a residential building in Zaporizhzhia this morning “certainly could” have been targeted at civilians, the <strong>White House</strong> has said. A senior Ukrainian official called it “a specific, deliberate strike at a residential building”. “It’s obviously right out of the Russian playbook to target civilian infrastructure and to show no regard for avoiding the targeting of civilians,” the White House’s spokesperson John Kirby said, adding that the US did not yet have “tactile information specifically about that strike”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russia will not leave “unanswered” a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/21/putin-says-russia-will-respond-if-uk-supplies-depleted-uranium-shells-to-ukraine"">UK plan</a> to supply Ukraine with tank shells made with depleted uranium</strong>, its foreign ministry has said. Separately, the Russian foreign minister, <strong>Sergei Lavrov</strong>, said Britain’s decision took the situation to new and dangerous levels. Britain’s foreign secretary, <strong>James Cleverley</strong>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-imf-and-ukraine-agree-15bn-funding-deal-us-rejects-chinas-impartiality-claim?page=with:block-641ae8998f0889459a75fd60#block-641ae8998f0889459a75fd60"">earlier today</a> said there was no “nuclear escalation” in the country’s decision.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russia’s deputy foreign minister</strong><strong> Sergei Ryabkov</strong><strong> has said the risk of a nuclear conflict is at its highest level in decades</strong>. Russia was committed to keeping the world “safe and free” from the threat of nuclear war, he said, but added later that business could not continue as usual, given that Moscow was now “in a de facto state of open conflict” with Washington.</p></li> 
 <li><p>British military intelligence said on Wednesday there was a possibility that the Russian assault on the town of <strong>Bakhmut</strong> was losing the limited momentum it had obtained. This could be because “some Russian MoD units have been reallocated to other sectors”, the Ministry of Defence said in its regular bulletin.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The <strong>International Committee of the Red Cross</strong> has said it is “deeply concerned” about the situation in <strong>Bakhmut</strong> and nearby communities around the frontline in eastern Ukraine and the “deep civilian suffering caused by constant military hostilities”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Maria Zakharova</strong>, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, has criticised the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague for its decision to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/17/vladimir-putin-arrest-warrant-ukraine-war-crimes"">issue arrest warrants</a> for Putin and the Russia’s children’s rights commissioner, Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, over the alleged illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. She cited evacuations of children by the US from Vietnam in the 1970s, and said she was “looking forward” to the ICC acting against the US leadership.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The Russian-backed administration in <strong>Sevastopol,</strong> in Crimea, said on Wednesday it had suspended ferry routes around the port city, shortly after the city’s governor said a Ukrainian drone attack had been repelled by air defences.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The RIA news agency reported that several radio stations were hacked in <strong>Crimea</strong>, and that “reports of a possible evacuation from the peninsula are false, authorities say”.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The spiritual head of the world’s Orthodox Christians said on Wednesday that Russia’s powerful Orthodox church shared responsibility for the conflict in Ukraine but that he stood ready to help in Russia’s postwar “spiritual regeneration”. <strong>Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew</strong>’s comments are a rebuke for Russian <strong>Patriarch Kirill</strong>, whose vocal support for Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine has splintered the worldwide Orthodox Church.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The US has offered to sell <strong>Slovakia</strong> 12 new <a href=""https://www.bellflight.com/products/bell-ah-1z"">Bell AH-1Z Viper helicopters</a> at a two-thirds discount after Bratislava sent its retired MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the defence minister, <strong>Jaroslav Nad,</strong> said on Wednesday.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The <strong>International Monetary Fund</strong> said on Tuesday it had reached a staff-level agreement with Ukraine for a four-year financing package worth about $15.6bn (£12.7bn), offering funds the country needs as it continues to defend itself against Russia’s invasion. The agreement, which must still be ratified by the IMF’s board, takes into consideration Ukraine’s path to accession to the European Union after the war. The fund said its executive board was expected to discuss approval in the coming weeks.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Xi and Putin’s meetings concluded on Tuesday when the Chinese and Russian leaders <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/21/putin-welcomes-chinas-controversial-proposals-for-peace-in-ukraine"">signed a series of documents on a “strategic cooperation”</a></strong> after what Putin described as “successful and constructive” talks that showed China-Russian relations were at the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/21/10-years-strengthening-ties-between-putin-xi-china-russia"">“highest point” in “the whole history of our two countries”</a>. The Chinese president’s trip to Moscow has been viewed as a major boost for his strategic partner, Putin.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Xi said China had an “impartial position” on the conflict in Ukraine and that it supported peace and dialogue, </strong>Russian state media reported. Xi said talks with his Russian counterpart had been<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/21/russia-ukraine-war-live-russian-cruise-missiles-destroyed-in-crimea-says-ukraine-xi-and-putin-to-hold-formal-talks?page=with:block-6419d89c8f08b01cb7e9ab59#block-6419d89c8f08b01cb7e9ab59""> “open and friendly”</a>.

Xi has invited Putin to visit China this year.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The US secretary of state,<strong> Antony Blinken, </strong>has said China is watching “very carefully” to see how Washington and the world respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.<strong> </strong>If Russia was allowed to attack Ukraine with impunity, it would “open a Pandora’s box” for would-be aggressors and lead to a “world of conflict”, he told lawmakers at a US senate appropriations subcommittee hearing on Wednesday.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The White House national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said the US </strong><strong>did not see China as capable of being an impartial mediator</strong> between Moscow and Kyiv over the war in Ukraine. He noted that China had continued to buy Russian oil even as the west piled sanctions on Moscow’s energy industry and said China kept “parroting the Russian propaganda”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Sweden’s parliament has formally approved a bill to allow the country to join Nato. </strong>Sweden and its neighbour Finland applied to join Nato in May 2022, abandoning decades of non-alignment after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The process has been held up by Turkey, which along with Hungary has yet to ratify the memberships. Membership in Nato “is the best way to safeguard Sweden’s security”, the Swedish foreign minister, Tobias Billström, said during the nearly seven-hour debate on Wednesday.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong> The Prince of Wales </strong><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/22/prince-of-wales-visits-british-and-polish-troops-near-ukraine-border"">has travelled to Warsaw</a> as part of a surprise two-day trip to Poland to thank British and Polish troops for their efforts supporting Ukraine, as well as to learn more about how the country has cared for displaced Ukrainian refugees.

 <li><p>China’s president, Xi Jinping, has arrived in Moscow in his first visit to Russia for four years. The state visit makes him the first world leader to meet Vladimir Putin since the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president. The pair are scheduled to have informal talks on Monday, with more formal negotiations to follow. The two leaders are expected to sign joint declarations.</p></li>

 <li><p>Upon his arrival, Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reported Xi said “China and Russia are good neighbours and reliable partners”. The Chinese president said he expected the visit to Russia would give a new impetus to the development of Russian-Chinese relations and strategic cooperation.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Russia and China “share the same, or some similar goals”, Xi told Putin at the Kremlin. Xi also told Putin he was sure the Russian people would support him in the 2024 presidential election, although Putin has not publicly declared that he will seek another term.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Putin told Xi he welcomed Beijing’s proposal to end the “acute crisis” in Ukraine and that he viewed the plan with respect.<strong> </strong>“You know that we are always ready for negotiating, and we will discuss all those questions including your suggestions,” the Russian leader told his Chinese counterpart.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken<strong>,</strong> has voiced scepticism over China’s “peace” proposals to end the Ukraine conflict, warning they could be a “stalling tactic” to help Russian troops on the ground in Ukraine. “The world should not be fooled by any tactical move by Russia, supported by China or any other country, to freeze the war on its own terms,” Blinken said at a briefing on Monday.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Any future peace plan must require Russia to withdraw its troops from all Ukrainian territory, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, has reiterated. The formula for the successful implementation of China’s “peace plan” must include the restoration of Ukraine’s “sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity”, Danilov tweeted.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Ahead of the trip, Putin <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/20/xi-set-to-visit-russia-in-trip-that-will-reaffirm-ties-with-putin-china"">praised Xi as a “good old friend”</a> in a newspaper article published in China<strong>, </strong>while Xi wrote in a Russian daily that his trip to Russia aimed to strengthen the friendship between the two countries and called for “pragmatism” on Ukraine.</p></li>

 <li><p>The prosecutor for the international criminal court (ICC) has said the world needs to “have the stamina” to enforce international law by trying those accused of war crimes in Ukraine, four days after the court took action against Vladimir Putin. Karim Khan also challenged the Kremlin to allow Ukrainian children abducted to Russia to return home, after his court issued an arrest warrant for Putin and Russia’s children’s commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, on the grounds that they had overseen the forcible transfer of thousands of children.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called the<strong> </strong>ICC’s arrest warrant against Putin a “turning point” in the conflict. In Zelensky’s nightly address, he said the warrant marked a “truly significant international legal result for Ukraine, for justice … The moment after which it becomes undeniable that the end of this aggression for Russia will be the full range of its responsibility.”</p></li> 
 <li><p>EU ministers have reached a deal to supply Ukraine with a million rounds of shells to bolster its defences against Russia’s invasion.<strong> </strong>EU foreign and defence ministers are still fine-tuning <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/20/eu-deal-supply-ukraine-ammunition"">a €1bn plan for the joint procurement of ammunition</a> by the Brussels-based European Defence Agency. Such an agreement would be a significant moment for the EU, which has limited experience of the joint purchase of military supplies.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The US will send Ukraine $350m (£285m) in weapons and equipment, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has announced.<strong> </strong>The latest aid package includes a large amount of various types of ammunition, such as rockets for the high mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars), Blinken said in a statement.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Putin, speaking on Monday before meeting Xi, said deepening ties between Moscow and African countries were a key goal for the Kremlin.<strong> </strong>In a televised address to delegates at a Russia-Africa parliamentary conference, Putin also said Russia would provide grain to African countries for free should the Black Sea grain deal not be extended in May.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner Group, has written to Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu<strong>,</strong> to warn that the Ukrainian army is planning an imminent offensive aimed at cutting off his forces from the main body of Russian troops in eastern Ukraine. In the letter published by his press service on Monday, Prigozhin said the “large-scale attack” was planned for late March or the start of April. The letter was the first time Prigozhin has published such correspondence with the defence minister.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Prigozhin also intensified his attack on Shoigu, calling the minister’s son-in-law a “scumbag blogger”.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Putin visited a command post in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don<strong>.</strong> Russian state-owned news agency Tass said Putin held a meeting at a military command and control post in the Russian city. It comes after Putin travelled to Russian-occupied Mariupol by helicopter, and visited Russian-occupied Crimea.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Ukraine’s ministry of defence accused Putin of visiting Mariupol “under the cover of night” in order to avoid showing destruction of city. In a <a href=""https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1637417207415046146"">Twitter post</a> the ministry said “darkness allows him to highlight what he wants to show, and keeps … its few surviving inhabitants away from prying eyes.”</p></li> 
 <li><p>Leaders of Ukraine’s Moscow-Patriarch-affiliated Orthodox church arrived near Ukraine’s presidential administration on Monday in an attempt to meet Zelenskiy.<strong> </strong>The church has been under pressure since November after Ukraine’s security services began a number of investigations into the church, saying they suspected the church of spreading pro-Kremlin narratives. The church leaders say they want to clarify their pro-Ukrainian position with Zelenskiy.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Ukraine’s armed forces have released their latest estimate for war casualties, although the Guardian cannot verify them. The country’s army now claims to have killed 164,910 Russian troops since the start of the war. Of these, they say 710 were killed in the 24 hours to Sunday morning. They also report having destroyed eight Russian artillery systems since Saturday.</p></li> 
 <li><p>A shortage of explosives is hampering the efforts of European countries to provide Ukraine with arms, according to a report. Industry insiders told the Financial Times that gunpowder, plastic explosives and TNT are in short supply and could delay a planned ramping up of shell production by as much as three years. It means Europe’s defence industry may be unable to meet expected EU orders for Ukraine.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Britain and Ukraine have signed a digital trade deal<strong>, </strong>which will give Ukraine access to electronic financial services to aid reconstruction efforts. The UK department of business and trade said trading digitally was particularly important in the conflict, because damage to Ukrainian infrastructure and warfare had made it much harder to trade physically.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Serbia’s president attacked the decision to issue an international arrest warrant for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin"">Putin</a>, saying it would only prolong the war in Ukraine. Aleksandar Vučić, who has previously boasted of his personal relationship with the Russian leader, told reporters in Belgrade: “I think issuing an arrest warrant for Putin, not to go into legal matters, will have bad political consequences and it says that there is a great reluctance to talk about peace (and) about truce.”</p></li>

Putin flew by helicopter to Mariupol, Russian news agencies reported, citing the Kremlin. It is the closest to the frontlines Putin has been in the year-long war. Driving a car, Putin travelled around several districts of the city in the Donetsk region, making stops and talking to people the reports named as residents.</p></li> <li><p>South Africa has said it is aware of its legal obligations relating to Putin’s international arrest warrant before his planned visit to the country in August, Reuters reports.

Pavlo Kyrylenko said a park had been targeted and “a dozen residential buildings” damaged. Agence France-Presse reporters heard about 10 explosions go off nearly simultaneously and said they saw a woman die at the scene from her wounds. Soon after, another round of explosions was heard in a neighbourhood 2km away.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia launched a series of attacks on Friday, according to the Ukrainian armed forces. </strong>Seven homes in the village of Veletenske in the Kherson region were destroyed and a nursery was damaged on Friday, but no one was injured, it said. The update, which the Guardian has not verified, also said 10 Iranian-made Shahed drones had been shot down, and that Ukrainian forces had “repelled more than 100 enemy attacks”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine said some of the overnight drone attacks hit the relatively peaceful western region of Lviv.</strong> Dnipro was also targeted, as was Kyiv, where air defences shot down all attacking drones.

Another five tanks, seven armoured combat vehicles and eight artillery systems were disabled by Ukrainian forces, it said in an update posted on Facebook.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia’s Wagner mercenary group plans to recruit about 30,000 new fighters by the middle of May, its founder has said. </strong>In an audio message on Telegram on Saturday, Yevgeny Prigozhin said that Wagner recruitment centres, which he said last week had opened in 42 Russian cities, were hiring an average of 500-800 people a day.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia would probably introduce wider conscription to boost its military requirements, the UK Ministry of Defence said. </strong>In its latest intelligence update, it said Russian Duma deputies introduced a bill to change the conscription age for men from the current 18-27 to 21-30. The law would probably be passed, it said, and come into force in January 2024.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Senior Ukrainian and US security officials met via video link on Saturday, with representatives of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government asking for further assistance</strong>, including more equipment, weapons and ammunition<strong>. </strong>Zelenskiy joined the call at the end of the meeting and discussed his forces’ hopes to retake areas Russia has captured.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The US president, Joe Biden, said the international criminal court’s (ICC’s) arrest warrant for Russian leader Vladimir Putin was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/18/biden-hails-decision-icc-arrest-warrant-against-putin"">“justified”</a></strong>. “But the question is – it’s not recognised internationally by us either,” Biden said, referring to the US not being a member of the ICC. “But I think it makes a very strong point.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, also <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/18/biden-hails-decision-icc-arrest-warrant-against-putin"">welcomed the ICC’s decision</a></strong>, saying: “The international criminal court is the right institution to investigate war crimes … The fact is nobody is above the law and that’s what’s becoming clear right now.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, visited the annexed peninsula of Crimea to mark nine years since Russia seized it</strong>.<strong> </strong>Russian state news agency RIA Novosti said Putin visited an art school and a children’s centre.

Ukraine is taking “an order of magnitude less” in fighting where “several thousand” shells a day have been fired by both sides, the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said. They added that it was unclear how long the battle for Bakhmut will go on.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Slovakia’s government on Friday approved a plan to give Ukraine its fleet of 13 Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets, becoming the second Nato member country to heed the Ukrainian government’s pleas for warplanes to help defend against Russia’s invasion. </strong>The prime minister, Eduard Heger, told a news conference that his government was “on the right side of history.” Earlier, Heger tweeted that military aid was key to ensuring Ukraine can defend itself and all of Europe against Russia. Slovakia grounded its MiG-29s in the summer due to a lack of spare parts and expertise to help maintain them after Russian technicians returned home. Ukraine’s air force continues to use MiG-29s.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Denmark</strong> was “open” to the idea of sending fighter jets to Ukraine to help its war effort against the Russian invasion, the Danish defence minister said on Friday, according to the state broadcaster DR. “I won’t rule out that at some point it may be necessary to look at the contribution of fighter jets,” the acting defence minister, <strong>Troels Lund Poulsen</strong>, said.</p></li> <li><p>The <strong>Kremlin</strong> said fighter planes supplied to Kyiv would be destroyed and would not change the course of the war.</p></li> <li><p><strong>China and Russia have confirmed that China’s president, Xi Jinping, will make a state visit to Russia on 20-22 March.</strong> “During the talks, they will discuss topical issues of further development of comprehensive partnership relations and strategic cooperation between Russia and China,” the Kremlin said. China’s foreign ministry said Xi would be exchanging opinions on international and regional issues with <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>, and the objective of the visit was to deepen bilateral trust.</p></li> <li><p>The White House said on Thursday that talks between the Ukrainian president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong>, and China’s president would be a “good thing,” but warned Beijing against taking a “one-sided” view of the conflict. There has been no confirmation of a call to Zelenskiy by Xi. However, Chinese foreign minister <strong>Qin Gang</strong> and his Ukrainian counterpart <strong>Dmytro Kuleba</strong> talked by phone Thursday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The US has deep concerns that China could try to position itself as a peacemaker in the war in Ukraine by promoting a ceasefire, </strong>the White House said on Friday. A ceasefire in Ukraine would “in effect recognise Russia’s gains and its attempt to conquer its neighbour’s territory by force, allowing Russian troops to continue to occupy sovereign Ukrainian territory”, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Britain</strong> has called on China to use President Xi’s trip to Moscow next week to encourage Putin to withdraw Russian troops from Ukraine. A spokesperson for the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: “If China wants to play a genuine role in restoring sovereignty to Ukraine, then we would obviously welcome that.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said Turkey would start the process of ratifying Finland’s Nato membership bid</strong> in parliament after the country took concrete steps to keep its promises. In a news conference on Friday after meetings with his Finnish counterpart, Erdoğan said: “When it comes to fulfilling its pledges in the trilateral memorandum of understanding, we have seen that Finland has taken authentic and concrete steps.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Turkey’s willingness to consider ratifying Sweden’s Nato bid would “depend on the solid steps Sweden will take”,</strong> Erdoğan said on Friday. His Finnish counterpart, <strong>Sauli Niinistö</strong>, welcomed Turkey’s decision to move on his country’s Nato bid, but also expressed solidarity with Sweden. Niinistö said: “I have a feeling that Finnish Nato membership is not complete without Sweden.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Sweden remains confident it will join the Nato alliance, foreign minister </strong><strong>Tobias Billström</strong><strong> has said,</strong> despite Turkey’s decision to move foward with ratifying Finland’s Nato application.

Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk told regional media on Tuesday that fewer than 4,000 civilians, including 38 children, remained in Bakhmut.

Nevertheless, Russian president, <strong>Vladimir Putin,</strong> “most likely calculates that time works in his favour,” Haines said, according to Agence France Presse.

Ukraine says Bakhmut has limited strategic value but has nevertheless put up fierce resistance. Not everyone in Ukraine is convinced that defending Bakhmut can go on indefinitely. “I believe that sooner or later, we will probably have to leave Bakhmut. There is no sense in holding it at any cost,” Ukrainian member of parliament <strong>Serhiy Rakhmanin</strong> said on NV radio late on Wednesday.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia attacked a five-storey apartment block in Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing three people and injuring six others.</strong> Rescuers are searching for survivors under the rubble.

The head of the Bryansk region claimed that a “sabotage group opened fire on a moving automobile. As a result, one resident was killed; a 10-year-old child was injured”. The reports of the attack set off a flurry of activity in the Kremlin and at Russia’s security services.

 <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy said the military situation in Ukraine’s south is “quite dangerous” in some places, while conditions in the east are “very difficult”</strong>. He said pro-Moscow forces had again shelled the southern city of <strong>Kherson</strong>, this time cutting off heat for 40,000 people.</p></li> 
 <li><p>In a further address in Lithuania given via video link, <strong>Zelenskiy</strong> said Russia had to lose its war in Ukraine to ensure it stopped seeking to conquer territories it once controlled. “Russian revanchism must forever forget about Kyiv and Vilnius, about Chișinău and Warsaw, about our brothers in Latvia and Estonia, in Georgia and every other country that is now threatened,” he said.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>China</strong>’s call for peace talks “doesn’t have much credibility”, the secretary-general of Nato, <strong>Jens Stoltenberg</strong>, said, as he warned Beijing against supplying arms to the Kremlin war machine. Stoltenberg told reporters: “China doesn’t have much credibility because they have not been able to condemn the illegal invasion of Ukraine and they also signed just days before the invasion an agreement between President Xi and President Putin on a limitless partnership with Russia.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>President Zelenskiy</strong> has welcomed some elements of a Chinese proposal for a ceasefire in Russia’s war on Ukraine.<strong> </strong>“China has shown its thoughts. I believe that the fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad,” Zelenskiy said.</p></li>

 <li><p>The Ukrainian presidential adviser, <strong>Mykhailo Podolyak</strong><strong>,</strong> has said any “peace plan” to end the conflict must involve the withdrawal of Russian troops to the borders of 1991. He said a ceasefire that resulted in the continued occupation by Russia of Ukrainian territory “isn’t about peace, but about freezing the war, Ukraine’s defeat, next stages of genocide”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Hungary</strong>’s prime minister, <strong>Viktor Orbán</strong>, said on Friday more talks between parliamentary groups were needed before Hungary’s ratification of <strong>Finland</strong> and <strong>Sweden</strong>’s Nato membership, which lawmakers will start debating next Wednesday.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>Sweden</strong> will send up to 10 Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, the prime minister, <strong>Ulf Kristersson,</strong> and defence minister, <strong>Pål Jonson,</strong> said.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>Denmark</strong> is “open” to the idea of sending fighter jets to Ukraine to help its war effort, the Danish defence minister said on Friday.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Britain is <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/24/british-typhoon-jets-ukraine-ben-wallace"">not planning to send RAF Typhoons</a> to Ukraine,</strong> the defence secretary, <strong>Ben</strong> <strong>Wallace</strong> said. Wallace said the jets would be too complex for Ukraine – but added, with the backing of Downing Street, the fighters could provide air cover for eastern bloc countries to backfill if they wanted to send their MiG-29 and other Soviet-era jets to Kyiv. </p></li> 
 <li><p>Wallace also said <strong>Britain</strong> is taking steps to rebuild its stockpiles of munitions which have been depleted by the war in Ukraine.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Britain</strong> has imposed an export ban on every piece of equipment Russia has been found using on the battlefield in Ukraine, the foreign secretary, <strong>James Cleverly</strong>, announced .</p></li> 
 <li><p>The <strong>archbishop of Canterbury</strong> said an end to the war in Ukraine cannot lead to Russia being treated like Germany after the first world war.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The former Russian president <strong>Dmitry Medvedev</strong> said the only way for Moscow to eventually ensure a lasting peace with Ukraine was to push back its own borders as far as possible, “even if these are the borders of Poland”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Some US and western officials estimate Russia’s military casualties at nearly 200,000 dead or wounded</strong>.<strong> </strong>Battlefield losses are impossible to verify independently, but soldiers fighting on the frontline and military officials have conceded that the death toll has spiked in recent weeks.

 <li><p><strong>A US army official has said it could take up to two years for M1 Abrams tanks to be delivered to Ukraine. </strong>The US announced in January that it would supply Ukraine with 31 advanced M1 Abrams tanks worth $400m in a matter of months.

 <li><p>Russia’s foreign ministry has warned that any actions threatening its troops in <strong>Moldova</strong>’s breakaway region of <strong>Transnistria</strong> would be seen as a direct attack on Russia and trigger an “adequate response”.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>Russian forces have stepped up attacks along the eastern frontline of the war in Ukraine</strong> as Kyiv prepares to mark the sombre first anniversary of the invasion. Amid fears that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, intends to mark the anniversary with fresh attacks on key cities, Ukraine’s general staff said it had repelled 90 assaults in the east and north-east in the past 24 hours. Russia has fired 5,000 missiles at Ukraine and carried out almost 3,500 airstrikes, according to Ukraine’s general staff.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The UN’s general assembly is expected to vote on a motion calling for the unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. </strong>The 193-member assembly is expected by a massive majority to endorse the broad resolution, but China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south are likely to continue to abstain.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>UN secretary general Ant</strong><strong>ónio Guterres condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “an affront to our collective conscience”</strong> at a two-day meeting of the general assembly. Friday’s anniversary is “a grim milestone for the people of Ukraine and for the international community”, he said in New York.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he had not seen any Chinese peace plan but he would welcome a meeting between Ukraine and China</strong>. “We would like to meet with China,” he said during a news briefing in Kyiv with the visiting Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, on the eve of the first anniversary the invasion. Sánchez, meanwhile, said: “I’m back in Ukraine a year after the start of the war. We will stay by Ukraine’s side until peace returns to Europe.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said the alliance had seen signs that China was considering supplying arms to Russia</strong> and warned Beijing against taking any such step.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has warned China that providing any material support to Russia’s war effort would be “a very serious concern”. </strong>“We will certainly continue to make clear to the Chinese government and to companies and banks in their jurisdictions what the rules are regarding our sanctions and the serious consequences that they would face in violating them,” she told reporters in India.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, met </strong><strong>Putin in Moscow on Wednesday,</strong> as China and Russia reaffirmed their close bilateral relationship. Wang told Putin that Beijing would play a “constructive” role in reaching a political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine, Russian state-owned Tass news agency reported.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Earlier on Wednesday, Wang met Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister,</strong> where he said he expected to reach a “new consensus” on advancing the relationship between the two allies. Xi Jinping, China’s president, is expected to visit Putin in Russia in the coming months.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The Biden administration is considering releasing intelligence it believes shows that China is weighing whether to supply weapons</strong> to Russia, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Putin has said Russia will deploy its new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, nicknamed “Satan 2”</strong>, as well as introduce hypersonic missiles and new nuclear submarines. In an address to mark the Defender of the Fatherland holiday on Thursday, Putin said Russia would “pay increased attention” to boost its nuclear forces on land, sea and in the air.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Joe Biden has said Putin made a “big mistake” by suspending the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US</strong>. Russia’s decision to suspend its participation in the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty with the US would not increase the risk of a nuclear war, Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said. Russia’s parliament on Wednesday approved suspending the treaty.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Putin has praised soldiers who are “fighting heroically, courageously, bravely”</strong> to “defend the fatherland” in a speech at a rally in Moscow on Wednesday to mark a year of war in Ukraine. Thousands of people gathered at Luzhniki stadium in Moscow to attend a concert marking the Defender of the Fatherland day.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, </strong><strong>Yevgeny Prigozhin</strong><strong>,</strong> <strong>has said much-needed ammunition for his troops has been dispatched,</strong> after a public row in which he accused the military leadership of treason. In an audio clip on Thursday, Prigozhin said he felt the pressure he and others had put on the defence ministry had paid off, and he had been told that ammunition was on its way.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The sanctions introduced by G7 nations against Russia since its invasion of Ukraine should be applied by all G20 countries, </strong>Italy’s economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, has said. Giorgetti said the sanctions “must be applied not only by the G7 countries but also by the G20 countries”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>EU countries have failed to agree on a new set of sanctions against Russia</strong> meant to be in place for the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, four diplomatic sources in Brussels told Reuters on Wednesday. More talks among Brussels representatives of EU member countries were due on Thursday afternoon, said the sources.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Australia will send drones to Ukraine and expand sanctions against Russian</strong> government, military and media figures as part of a pledge to stand with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. The package includes travel bans and asset freezes for a further 90 Russian individuals and 40 Russian entities, including the state-owned media outlet Sputnik.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Finland will send three Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine</strong>, the country’s defence ministry has said. The announcement comes after <strong>Sweden</strong>’s defence minister said it was open to sending some of its Leopard battle tanks. The <strong>Czech</strong> government has also announced a further military aid shipment to Ukraine.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Britain has begun to “warm up” its production lines to replace weapons sent to Ukraine</strong> and increase production of artillery shells to try to help Kyiv push back Russian forces, defence minister Ben Wallace has said. In an interview with Reuters, Wallace said he believed Britain was in a good place to help Ukraine but needed to sustain the provision of weapons.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>A Russian fighter plane crashed on Thursday and the pilot was killed in Russia’s Belgorod region, </strong>near the border with Ukraine. The cause of the crash was a “technical malfunction”, according to preliminary information, the Russian state-run Tass news agency cited the ministry as saying. The plane crashed in an uninhabited area and there were no reports of other damage, it said.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Moldova has dismissed an accusation by Russia’s defence ministry that Ukraine planned to invade the breakaway Moldovan region of </strong><strong>Transnistria</strong> after staging a false-flag operation, and called for calm. The Russian ministry said Ukraine planned to stage an attack purportedly by Russian forces from Transnistria as a pretext for the invasion, state media reported.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Ukrainian courts have brought charges against nearly 300 </strong><strong>people for war crimes</strong> since Russia’s invasion a year ago, an official has said. Ukraine’s prosecutor coordinating war crimes cases in The Hague, Myroslava Krasnoborova, said 26 individuals had been tried and convicted and in all 276 people had been charged with war crimes.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The Kerch </strong><strong>Bridge, which connects mainland Russia to the occupied Crimean peninsula, has reopened to road traffic,</strong> the deputy prime minister, Marat Khusnullin, has announced. The bridge, which has served as a vital transport link for carrying military equipment to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, was partially destroyed by a blast in October.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>A Russian man who has lived in Poland for many years has been charged with spying,</strong> Polish authorities said. The suspect was detained in April on suspicion of collecting information between 2015 and April 2022 concerning the military readiness of Poland’s armed forces and of Nato, and passing them on to the Russian intelligence service.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>A series of cyber-attacks on Wednesday targeting Italian companies and public institutions,</strong> including the websites of the defence ministry and police, were “a threat, a warning” from Russia, Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, has said. The attacks, which were claimed by the Russian group NoName057, came after Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni’s, visit to Ukraine this week.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Two civilians have been killed in Russian shelling of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine on Wednesday,</strong> according to regional officials. Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the regional military administration, said an 81-year-old woman and a 68-year-old man were killed during shelling of the village of Novotyahinka, about 40 km (25 miles) from Kherson city. A Russian missile strike on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv on Wednesday morning has also left two civilians wounded, Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv region, has said.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Biden vowed that the US will defend “literally every inch of Nato” territory </strong>ahead of talks with Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9), a collection of nations on the most eastern parts of the Nato alliance and closest to Russia. </p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>All members of the </strong><strong>B9</strong><strong> have jointly condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine,</strong> a Polish presidential adviser said. Biden and the B9 leaders “reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine and underscored their shared commitment to stand with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes” according to a White House account of Wednesday afternoon’s meeting in Warsaw.</p></li>

Another adviser, <strong>Anton Gerashchenko</strong>, said “The insolent thief said that Russian farmers harvested a “record harvest” last year.

Your visit is an extremely important sign of support for all Ukrainians,” he said on <a href=""https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/5182"">Telegram</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The visit came as it was disclosed that Biden would announce an additional $500m in military aid including artillery ammunition, anti-armour systems, and air surveillance radars in the coming days.</strong> The timing – before a planned address by Vladimir Putin – was seen as a deliberate rebuke of the Russian president. In a statement issued by the White House, Biden said he was in Kyiv to reaffirm the US’s “unwavering and unflagging commitment to Ukraine’s democracy, sovereignty, and territorial integrity”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy said he and Biden spoke about “long-range weapons and the weapons that may still be supplied to Ukraine”</strong> that haven’t been supplied before.

 <li><p>French president <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> urged allies to intensify their military support for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> to help the country carry out a needed counter-offensive against Russia. “We absolutely need to intensify our support and our effort to the resistance of the Ukrainian people and its army and help them to launch a counter-offensive which alone can allow credible negotiations, determined by Ukraine, its authorities and its people,” he said at the Munich security conference.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Allies that can deliver battle tanks to Ukraine should do so now, <strong>Olaf Scholz</strong> of Germany said at the same event. Germany would facilitate this decision by providing logistics and stock replenishment and by training Ukrainian soldiers, he said, adding: “For me, that is an example of the kind of leadership people can expect from Germany.”</p></li> 
 <li><p>Russia’s defence ministry website has posted an update confirming a new leadership appointment of its military district, state-run media is reporting. <strong>Lt Gen Andrey Mordvichev</strong> is now head of the central military district, replacing <strong>Col Gen Alexandr Lapin,</strong> who was appointed chief of staff of Russia’s ground forces last month.

Now the American warmongers have gone even further: they are inciting the Kyiv regime to further escalate, simply to transfer the war to the territory of our country.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Nuland</strong> had told the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington the US considers that Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, should be demilitarised at a minimum and Washington supports Ukrainian attacks on military targets on the peninsula.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The first batch of <strong>Leopard-1A5 battle tanks the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany are buying for Ukraine will be delivered as soon as possible,</strong> the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said.

 <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy has ruled out giving up any Ukrainian territory in a potential peace deal with Russia. </strong>In an interview with the BBC, Ukraine’s leader said conceding land would mean Russia could “keep coming back”.

Stoltenberg said Ukraine’s use of ammunition was “many times higher than our current rate of production”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Stoltenberg said on Tuesday it was more important that Finland and Sweden’s applications to join the alliance were ratified quickly than together. </strong>The two countries applied to join Nato following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and their membership bids have been ratified by all allies except Hungary and Turkey.

 <li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy made a powerful appeal to the UK to supply Ukraine with fighter jets</strong> in a historic speech to members of the Commons and the Lords at Westminster Hall. He presented Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker of the Commons, with the helmet of a fighter pilot on which the pilot had written: “We have freedom. Give us the wings to protect it.” Zelenskiy’s appeal may be broader – an effort to persuade the UK to act as a lobbyist to help Ukraine secure F-16s from the US, with Britain helping, as announced, with initial pilot training in simulators to get the process going.</p></li>

<ul> 
 <li><p>Hours after Zelenskiy’s speech to the UK parliament,<strong> </strong>Downing Street announced that prime minister<strong> Rishi Sunak had asked Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, to investigate which jets the UK might be able to send to Ukraine in the future. </strong>A spokesperson for the PM stressed that no decision had been taken on whether to supply UK jets to Ukraine, but that the issue is being “actively” considered by Wallace.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The Russian embassy to Britain has warned the UK against sending fighter jets to Ukraine,</strong> after Downing Street confirmed Sunak had asked his defence secretary to investigate, Russian state media is reporting. Such a move would have “military and political consequences for the European continent and the entire world”, the embassy said, according to state-run Tass news agency.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The Ukrainian leader was embraced by the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, as he arrived in the UK</strong> for his first visit since the Russian invasion. The visit marked the second time Zelenskiy has left Ukraine since the start of the war. King Charles held an audience with Zelenskiy at Buckingham Palace after the Ukrainian leader addressed British MPs and peers in Westminster Hall. During his address to parliament, Zelenskiy said: “In Britain, the king is an air force pilot. In Ukraine today, every air force pilot is a king.”</p></li>

<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>Sunak also pledged additional military support and training to Ukraine as Zelenskiy arrived in the UK</strong>. The expansion of the UK’s training programme to include jet fighter pilots is significant as Zelenskiy has repeatedly called on western countries to supply planes. Ukrainian troops are being trained in the use of Challenger 2 tanks, which are expected to be sent to the country next month.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The UK also announced a number of new Russia-related sanctions </strong>targeting people who have helped Vladimir Putin build his personal wealth, as well as firms that have profited from the war. Individuals placed under sanctions include the presidential commissioner for entrepreneur’s rights, Boris Titov, and the owner of Aerostart, Viktor Myachin, as well as Putin’s alleged former lover Svetlana Krivonogikh.</p></li> 
 <li><p>In a joint press conference with Zelenskiy, <strong>Sunak said “nothing is off the table” when it comes to the provision of military assistance to Ukraine. </strong>The UK is “accelerating” the delivery of equipment to Ukraine to “ensure that it reaches Ukraine’s frontline in coming days and weeks, not months or years, Sunak told reporters, adding that the Ukrainian crews who arrived in the UK last week will be using Challenger 2 main battle tanks to defend Ukraine next month.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy is expected to travel to Paris later today to meet French president Emmanuel Macron and the German </strong><strong>chancellor, Olaf Scholz. </strong>In a speech to the Bundestag lower house of parliament on Wednesday, Scholz criticised the “public competition” among some countries over who can supply weapons to Ukraine, arguing that it “harms unity” among allies. “Cohesion within our alliances is our most valuable asset,” Scholz said.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>On Thursday, Zelenskiy is </strong><strong>expected to travel to Brussels, where leaders of EU countries are gathering for a summit.</strong> A senior Ukrainian official said his president would ask EU leaders for more arms to fight Russia and to move quickly on his country’s bid to join the bloc.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Western allies could deliver the first battalion of Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine in the first three or four months of this year, </strong>Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, has said. A battalion would consist of about 31 tanks, he added during a trip to the Polish capital on Wednesday.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Poland and the Baltic states have urged the EU to work on seizing frozen Russian state assets for the reconstruction of Ukraine “as soon as possible”,</strong> raising pressure to act on a legally fraught question. Ahead of a two-day EU summit that will discuss the Russian invasion, the leaders of Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia said “in order to be credible on this matter vis-a-vis Ukraine” the bloc had to go beyond reiterating previous commitments and “accelerate our work in the council right now”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Since Russia withdrew its forces from the west bank of the Dnipro in November, “skirmishing and reconnaissance” has continued </strong>on the network of islands comprising the Dnipro delta, according to the UK ministry of defence. “It is highly unlikely that Russia will attempt an assault crossing of the Dnipro,” the latest intelligence update said. “It would likely be extremely complex and costly.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>There are “strong indications” </strong><strong>Putin personally signed off on a decision to supply the missile that downed flight MH17 in 2014</strong>, a team of international investigators has said. However, investigators said the evidence was not enough to lead to prosecution. The Boeing 777 was flying over eastern Ukraine when it was shot down by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile in July 2014, killing all 298 people onboard.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The former Pink Floyd rockstar, Roger Waters, has appeared before a UN security council meeting about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</strong> Waters, who has a record of blaming the US and the west in general, for allegedly provoking the invasion, spoke by video link where he claimed to be speaking on behalf of “four billion or so brothers and sisters” in what he called a “voiceless majority, who together with the millions in the international antiwar movement represent a huge constituency”. Ukraine’s permanent representative, Sergiy Kyslytsya, was scathing about Waters’ intervention, and drew on his Pink Floyd past to rebuke him</p></li> 
 <li><p>The mayor of Paris, <strong>Anne Hidalgo</strong>, made clear she did not want a Russian delegation at next year’s games. Her remarks came after <strong>five Olympic committees in the Nordic region – Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway</strong> – urged the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Tuesday to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from participating in international sports.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russia said on Wednesday that work to unblock Russian exports under the Black Sea grain deal was unsatisfactory,</strong> accusing the EU of failing to deliver on its promises, the Tass news agency reported. The comments refer to the UN-brokered agreement between Moscow and Kyiv that aimed to free up grain exports held up at Black Sea ports by the war in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a>.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The Russian deputy prime minister, <strong>Alexander Novak,</strong> said on Wednesday that EU moves to add what he called “exemptions” to its price cap on oil products showed that Russian oil was still in demand, Reuters reports.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russia has demanded that the US embassy in Moscow stop spreading what Moscow regards as fake news</strong> regarding its military operation in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> and has threatened to expel US diplomats, Reuters reports, citing an original report in the Tass news agency.</p></li>

Zelenskiy was reported to be planning a trip to Brussels this Thursday to meet EU leaders in person at a summit and address the European parliament in an extraordinary session.

In remarks during a conference call with military officials, quoted by state-owned Tass news agency, Shoigu accused the US and its allies of “trying to prolong the conflict as much as possible” by supplying Kyiv with what he described as “heavy offensive weapons”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Weeks of intense fighting continued to rage around the city of Bakhmut and the nearby towns of Soledar and Vuhledar,</strong> Ukraine’s presidential office said.

In Luhansk, fellow governor Serhiy Haidai said shelling there had subsided because “the Russians have been saving ammunition for a large-scale offensive”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Weeks of intense fighting continued to rage around the city of Bakhmut and the nearby towns of Soledar and Vuhledar,</strong> Ukraine’s presidential office said. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said on Monday that Russia was continuing to make small advances in its efforts to encircle the Donbas city of Bakhmut. “While multiple alternative cross-country supply routes remain available to Ukrainian forces, Bakhmut is increasingly isolated,” the ministry said on Twitter.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The western area of the Luhansk region is likely to be the focus of any new Russian offensive, said Kyrylo Budanov,</strong> the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, who has been tipped to take over the Ministry of Defence. In an interview with the Financial Times, he said that offensive would most likely be launched by “proper mechanised brigades” rather than the ill-trained reservists and Wagner mercenaries who have been suffering heavy casualties in recent battles.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine is bracing for a possible Russian offensive this month before the first anniversary of its invasion of Ukraine.</strong> “There are already many reports that the occupiers want to do something symbolic in February to try to avenge their last year’s defeats,” the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his Sunday night address. “We see this increased pressure in various areas of the frontline, as well as pressure in the information field.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine has faced temperatures as low as -20C (-4F) this winter, at the same time as dealing with a humanitarian crisis as Russia hits </strong><strong>vital civilian infrastructure,</strong> analysis has shown. Areas in Dnipro, Donetsk and Kharkiv are particularly vulnerable, according to research. Some areas are housing tens of thousands of displaced people through the winter, at the same time as crucial infrastructure – including energy and housing – is being targeted by Russian missiles and artillery.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Kyiv has the reserves to hold back Moscow’s forces even though the latest western military supplies will not all arrive in time</strong>, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has claimed. “Not all of the western weaponry will arrive in time. But we are ready. We have created our resources and reserves, which we are able to deploy and with which we are able to hold back the attack.” Reznikov added that the attack would be for “symbolic” reasons but its resources were not ready from a military point of view. “Despite everything, we expect a possible Russian offensive in February. This is only from the point of view of symbolism; it’s not logical from a military view. Because not all of their resources are ready. But they’re doing it anyway,” he said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Reznikov, under pressure from a corruption scandal, is to be <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/05/talk-of-resignation-and-retreat-swirls-in-ukraine-as-bakhmut-enters-endgame"">reshuffled into another government job</a>,</strong> a close ally of Zelenskiy announced on Sunday. Reznikov will be replaced by <strong>Kyrylo Budanov,</strong> head of Ukraine’s military intelligence. His position had been under threat after it emerged the defence ministry paid twice or three times the supermarket price of food to supply troops on the frontline. On Monday, David Arakhamia said any replacement of Reznikov would not take place this week.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The UN</strong><strong> secretary general, António Guterres, </strong><strong>said the world </strong><strong>risked walking into a “wider war” over Ukraine. </strong>Addressing the UN general assembly just weeks before the first anniversary of Russia’s 24 February invasion, Guterres said: “The prospects for peace keep diminishing. The chances of further escalation and bloodshed keep growing.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>The EU’s legislature is preparing plans to host </strong><strong>Zelenskiy should he decide to come to Brussels to attend an EU summit later this week,</strong> according to reports. The Ukrainian leader is expected to address a special session of the European parliament, the Financial Times writes, adding that the proposed plan is subject to security concerns that risk derailing Zelenskiy’s trip.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Germany’s plan to quickly assemble two battalions of Leopard 2 tanks from European allies and send them to Ukraine is progressing slower than expected. </strong>Several states have yet to decide whether they can spare vehicles from their own stocks.

Under the codename “Mikhailov” and officially in Geneva as a representative of the Russian Orthodox church at the World Council of Churches (WCC), Kirill’s mission was to influence the council and push it to denounce the US and its allies, the papers reported.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Iran and Russia are looking to build a factory in Russia that could supply more than 6,000 Iranian-designed drones for the war in Ukraine, according to reports.</strong> <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/moscow-tehran-advance-plans-for-iranian-designed-drone-facility-in-russia-11675609087?mod=hp_lead_pos8"">The Wall Street Journal</a> claimed that the two governments are moving ahead with plans, and that an Iranian delegation went to Russia in January to visit the planned site.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov arrived in Iraq on Sunday</strong> for talks on energy and food security in view of the Ukraine conflict, an Iraqi foreign ministry spokesperson said. Lavrov will also visit Mali this week, in a trip that the west African country’s government says will strengthen defence and security ties. It will be the first time a Russian foreign minister has visited Mali, and is part of a push by Moscow to extend its influence over countries in Africa.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The EU-imposed ban on Russian seaborne oil products will come into force on Monday. </strong>The 27-nation bloc is banning Russian refined oil products such as diesel fuel and joining the US and other allies in imposing a price cap on sales to non-western countries. A ban on Russian seaborne crude came into force on 5 December and the extension to oil products will mean that 70% of Russian energy exports will now be subject to sanction. Oil products represent a third of Russian oil exports.</p></li> </ul>","FALSE","pillar/news","News"

We consider Bakhmut our fortress,” Zelenskiy told a news conference with top European Union officials following a summit in Kyiv. “Ukraine would be able to hold Bakhmut and liberate occupied Donbas if it received long-range weapons,” he said.</p></li> <li><p>Senior EU officials including the European Commission president, <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong>, the European Council president, <strong>Charles Michel</strong>, and 15 European commissioners travelled to the Ukrainian capital for talks. <strong>Air raid sirens twice sounded across Ukraine on Friday </strong>as President Zelenskiy hosted EU leaders in Kyiv. The first air alert in Kyiv was on Friday morning. The second, hours later, followed a joint news conference involving Zelenskiy, von der Leyen and Michel. There were no immediate reports of any Russian airstrikes on Kyiv throughout the day.</p></li> <li><p><strong>EU leaders offered strong support for Ukraine but set “no rigid timelines” for its accession to the bloc. </strong>President Zelenskiy had hoped the EU would put Ukraine on a rapid track to membership, but western EU member states are concerned that Kyiv’s expectations on speedy membership talks are unrealistic. “There are no rigid timelines, but there are goals that you have to reach,” von der Leyen told the news conference.</p></li> <li><p><strong>President Zelenskiy appealed to the EU to impose sanctions on Russia’s state-run nuclear monopoly Rosatom</strong> and its top managers. Zelenskiy said during talks with EU leaders on Friday that they had discussed “the extension of the energy sanctions to cover the nuclear sphere”. He argued sanctions should target Rosatom and its managers, whom he accused of the seizure and forced nationality change of staff at Ukrainian nuclear power facilities and their children.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The EU has promised a 10th package of sanctions against Russia will be in place by 24 February</strong>, the first anniversary of the war. Speaking alongside Zelenskiy, Ursula von der Leyen said the package would cover trade worth €10bn and focus on technology used by the Russian military, such as drone components, as well as measures to counter circumvention of sanctions. The next round of EU sanctions, however, is not expected to include nuclear power, which Hungary has already threatened to block.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy had called on Thursday for more punitive EU measures against Russia</strong><strong>, but new sanctions the bloc is preparing </strong><strong>will fall short of his government’s demands. </strong>“We see today that the pace of sanctions in Europe has slowed down a little,” Zelenskiy said at a news conference. “The terrorist state increases the pace of adaptation to sanctions instead. It should be resolved. We believe that we can do it together.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Maria Zakharova</strong>, a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, responded to the Ukrainian president’s comments by saying: “Western Europe, falling into recession, having long lost the habit of survival, is sinking, with Ukraine tied to its feet.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>EU member countries have agreed on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products,</strong> the Swedish presidency of the EU said. Ambassadors of the 27 EU states agreed at a meeting to impose a $100-per-barrel cap on premium products such as diesel and a $45 cap on low-end products, according to diplomats. The price cap comes into effect on Sunday, as does the EU’s ban on Russian oil product imports.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The US has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $2.175bn (£2.2bn). </strong>The package will include precision-guided rockets and HAWK air-defence firing units, as well as other munitions and weapons, the US state department said. Significantly, it includes the Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB) for the first time, which will double Ukraine’s strike range and allow Ukraine’s military to strike deep behind the frontlines of the war.</p></li> <li><p><strong>France and Italy have finalised technical talks for the joint delivery of the SAMP/T air defence system to Ukraine in spring 2023,</strong> the French defence ministry announced. It comes after Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said on Thursday that the SAMP/T system would be operational in Ukraine “within seven to eight weeks”. The system can track dozens of targets and intercept 10 at once. It is the only European-made system that can intercept ballistic missiles.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The EU has pledged to double a military aid programme for Ukraine by training an extra 15,000 soldiers, </strong>as part of a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/02/eu-pledges-to-double-military-aid-programme-for-ukraine"">blizzard of announcements</a> aimed at showing it will “stand by Ukraine for the long haul”. The EU will launch a humanitarian de-mining programme in Ukraine worth €25m, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, confirmed. De-mining is “crucial to save the lives of civilian population”, Borrell said. The EU will also supply Ukraine with 35m LED lightbulbs, 2,400 generators on top of 3,000 already delivered and promised funding for solar panels to power Ukraine’s public buildings.</p></li> <li><p>The prosecutor general’s office of Ukraine has pressed criminal charges against <strong>Yevgeny Prigozhin</strong>, the head of the <strong>Wagner group</strong> of mercenaries fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. Prigozhin has been charged with encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine and of waging a war of aggression against Ukraine.</p></li> <li><p>There are reports that one person was killed in a car bomb explosion in occupied <strong>Enerhodar,</strong> in <strong>Zaporizhzhia</strong> region. <strong>Dmitri Orlov</strong>, Ukraine’s mayor of the city, claimed the victim was a former Ukrainian police officer who had defected to help the authorities in the area of Ukraine that the Russian Federation has claimed to annex</p></li> <li><p>The Kremlin spokesperson <strong>Dmitry Peskov</strong> said on Friday morning that the war would continue in Ukraine as <strong>Donbas</strong> was not “fully protected yet”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Germany</strong> has approved a delivery of Leopard 1 main battle tanks to Ukraine from industrial stocks, government spokesperson <strong>Steffen Hebestreit</strong> has said. Hebestreit confirmed “an export licence has been issued” for the delivery by a private arms-marker of its older Leopard 1 tanks, but did not provide further details.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Germany is also understood to be in the process of preparing a joint weapons package with Sweden</strong> in which Stockholm would provide air-defence missiles and launching platforms for Germany’s Iris-T systems. Robert Habeck, the German deputy chancellor and economic minister, discussed this joint package in a meeting with the Swedish minister for foreign trade, Johan Forssell, during a state visit on Thursday, one government official said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Germany will not play a “key” role in the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv because “it is American technology”</strong>,<strong> </strong>Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said. In an interview with BBC News Ukraine, Kuleba said he had “no doubt” that the decision to supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets would be made, adding that Kyiv was “open to communication with all partners” on aircraft such as the Swedish Gripens, French Mirages and Rafales.</p></li> <li><p>Russian-installed authorities in <strong>Crimea</strong> said on Friday they had nationalised about 500 properties in the peninsula, including some belonging to senior Ukrainian politicians and business figures.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Nato</strong> has called on Russia to fulfil its obligations under the <strong>Start nuclear reductions treaty</strong>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Norway</strong> will order 54 new German-made Leopard tanks for its army from the KraussMaffei Group, the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported on Friday.</p></li> <li><p>Traders are using <strong>Turkey</strong>, <strong>Kazakhstan</strong> and <strong>Armenia</strong> to evade European Union sanctions on Russia in a tactic that breaches these countries’ compliance with the bloc’s embargo, <strong>Latvia</strong>’s prime minister said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The EU said on Thursday it intended to work with Ukrainian prosecutors to set up an international centre for the prosecution of the crime of aggression in Ukraine,</strong> to be located in The Hague.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said on Thursday that sending fighter jets to Ukraine would require “months if not years” of training</strong> and that he was looking for the most effective way of helping Kyiv secure victory.</p></li> <li><p>The head of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games has said it is for the <strong>International Olympic Committee</strong> (IOC) to decide whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can compete in the Games next year.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia is planning a major offensive to coincide with the one-year anniversary of </strong><strong>its invasion on 24 February,</strong> according to Ukraine’s defence minister.

It is likely that people are still underneath,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app. At least 44 people were killed last month when a Russian missile hit an apartment building in the eastern city of Dnipro.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Two more Russian missiles struck Kramatorsk on Thursday</strong>.<strong> </strong>The latest strikes have resulted in civilian casualties, said the head of the regional military administration, <strong>Pavlo Kyrylenko,</strong> but it is not clear how many.

Among them are minister of internal affairs of Ukraine <strong>Denys Monastyrskyi</strong>, his first deputy <strong>Yevhen Yenin</strong>, state secretary of the ministry of internal affairs <strong>Yuri Lubkovych</strong>, their assistants and the helicopter crew. 25 people were injured, including ten children.

 <li><p>Vladimir Putin has instructed his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, to introduce a 36-hour ceasefire along the entire line of contact in Ukraine from noon on Friday to midnight on Saturday, the Kremlin has said. Russian troops must hold fire for 36 hours to allow people “in the areas of hostilities” to mark Orthodox Christmas, the Russian leader said.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Putin’s announcement came hours after the head of the Russian Orthodox church, Patriarch Kirill, called for a ceasefire and a Christmas truce in Ukraine. In a statement, Kirill said he appealed to “all parties involved in the internecine conflict” for the ceasefire, so that “Orthodox people can attend services on Christmas Eve and the day of the nativity of Christ”.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior aide to Ukraine’s president, dismissed Putin’s calls for a temporary ceasefire to mark Orthodox Christmas. He said a “temporary truce” would be possible only when Russia leaves territory it is occupying in Ukraine. Other Ukrainian politicians said Russia’s offer of a ceasefire came just days after it launched a wave of strikes on Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, as Ukrainians celebrated the new year.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Putin is “trying to find some oxygen” by floating a 36-hour ceasefire to mark Orthodox Christmas, said Joe Biden. “I’m reluctant to respond [to] anything Putin says,” Biden told reporters. “I found it interesting. He was ready to bomb hospitals and nurseries and churches on the 25th and new year.”</p></li> 
 <li><p>Prior to the ceasefire announcement, Putin told his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Russia was open to dialogue over Ukraine but Kyiv would have to accept the “new territorial realities”, according to a readout of the call between the two leaders issued by the Kremlin. Putin also “acknowledged the destructive role of the west, pumping weapons into Kyiv, providing information and guidance”, the Kremlin said. Putin and Erdoğan also discussed a number of energy issues, including the creation of a gas hub in Turkey and the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant, it added.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Erdoğan told Putin during the call on Thursday that peace efforts in the Russia-Ukraine war should be supported by a unilateral ceasefire and a “vision for a fair solution”,<strong> </strong>the Turkish presidency said in its readout of the call. The two leaders discussed energy and the Black Sea grain corridor, and Erdoğan told Putin concrete steps needed to be taken to clear Kurdish militants from the Syrian border region, it added.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also spoke with Turkey’s leader about “security cooperation” as well as the exchange of prisoners of war and the Black Sea grain initiative, Zelenskiy said. He added he was “glad to hear that Turkey is ready to participate in the implementation” of his “peace formula”, which he first proposed in November.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The first inmates recruited by the private military group Wagner have received their promised pardons after fighting for six months in Ukraine, Wagner’s founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, told journalists on Thursday. “They worked off their contract. They worked with honour, with dignity. They were the first ones. Nobody else in this world works as hard as they did,” Prigozhin told the Russian news agency RIA-Novosti, standing alongside a number of former convicts. Addressing the former prisoners, Prigozhin instructed them not to end up back in jail.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk oblast – one of the regions the Russian Federation claims to have annexed – has posted a status update in which he says two people have been killed by Russian fire in the last 24 hours.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Overnight, Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), has said that service personnel injured in the attack on the barracks in occupied Makiivka have been mostly transferred to hospitals within <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"">Russia</a>.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Ukraine’s gross domestic product fell by 30.4% in 2022 – the largest annual fall in more than 30 years – because of the war with Russia, the economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said. She said Ukraine’s economy had suffered its largest losses since it won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 although the fall was less than initially expected. Ukraine’s GDP had grown by 3.4% in 2021.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said France would send light AMX-10 RC armoured combat vehicles, an Elysée official said after a phone call between Macron and Zelenskiy. In a video address, during which he thanked France for providing them, the Ukrainian president said: “This is what gives a clear signal to all our other partners. There is no rational reason why western-style tanks have not yet been supplied to Ukraine.”</p></li>

 <li><p>The provision of tanks may well be part of “the next phase” of weapons transfers to Ukraine, the UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said after a meeting in London with Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, on Thursday. Speaking at a joint press conference with Baerbock, Cleverly said the position on the provision of tanks is kept under constant review.</p></li> 
 <li><p>A wide-ranging public discussion is taking place in Ukraine over <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/05/a-volatile-canvas-banksy-bequest-in-ukraines-rubble-leaves-dilemma-for-preservers"">what to do with seven street murals painted in November by the British artist Banksy</a> on a series of destroyed buildings in and around Kyiv. The conversation has grown urgent after thieves last month made off with one artwork from the town of Hostomel<strong>,</strong> about 15 miles (25km) outside the capital. It shows a woman in a gas mask and dressing gown holding a red fire extinguisher. She is standing next to a real flame-blackened window.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The US is not “hand-wringing” over the mass casualties of Russian soldiers in a Ukrainian attack reportedly using US-supplied artillery, a senior White House official said on Wednesday. After criticism in Russia over the use of US-delivered weaponry by Ukrainian defenders, including in the Makiivka strike, the national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said Russia is to blame.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Biden said the US was considering sending Bradley Fighting Vehicles to Ukraine. The armoured vehicle with a powerful gun has been used as a staple by the US army to carry troops around battlefields since the mid-1980s.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The US is also looking at ways to target Iranian drone production through sanctions and export controls, the White House said. Washington previously imposed sanctions on companies and people it accused of producing or transferring Iranian drones that Russia has used against Ukraine.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Russia’s defence ministry on Wednesday blamed the illegal use of mobile phones by its soldiers for a deadly Ukrainian missile strike that it said killed 89 servicemen, raising the reported death toll significantly. Moscow previously said <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/04/makiivka-strike-what-we-know-about-the-deadliest-attack-on-russian-troops-since-ukraine-war-began"">63 Russian soldiers were killed</a> in the weekend strike on Makiivka. Although an official investigation has been launched, the main reason for the attack was clearly the illegal mass use of mobile phones by servicemen, the ministry said. “This factor allowed the enemy to track and determine the coordinates of the soldiers’ location for a missile strike,” it said in a statement issued just after 1am in Moscow on Wednesday.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The Ukrainian deputy defence minister said significant Russian losses meant Moscow would probably have to announce a second partial mobilisation in the first quarter of the year.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Further strikes deep in Russian territory should be expected, the head of the Ukrainian military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, has told the US TV network ABC. He said the attacks would come “deeper and deeper” inside Russia, without specifically saying whether <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> would be behind them.</p></li>

 <li><p>The <strong>UK’s Ministry of Defence</strong>, in its daily intelligence briefing, said “Given the extent of the damage, there is a realistic possibility that ammunition was being stored near to troop accommodation, which detonated during the strike creating secondary explosions. The Russian military has a record of unsafe ammunition storage from well before the current war, but this incident highlights how unprofessional practices contribute to Russia’s high casualty rate.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Denis Pushilin</strong>, who acts as the leader of pro-Russian occupiers in Donetsk, has praised the bravery of the soldiers who survived the attack. RIA quotes him saying: “We know, and we know first-hand, what it is to bear losses. And what real heroism is. Based on the information that I have, I can say with confidence that the guys from this regiment had many manifestations of courage and real heroism.”</p></li> 
 <li><p>About 200 people gathered in the Russian city of <strong>Samara</strong> on Tuesday to hold a vigil for soldiers from the city killed in the Makiivka attack. Mourners laid wreaths and roses in Samara’s central square, while priests recited prayers for the dead.</p></li>

His trip to the US – his first since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – came amid concern that the incoming Republican leadership of the House of Representatives <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/18/republicans-ukraine-midterm-elections"">might oppose proposals for an additional $45bn in weapons and other assistance next year</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The White House announced <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/22/zelenskiy-invokes-fight-against-nazi-germany-in-speech-to-us-congress"">a further $1.85bn in aid</a> including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles</strong> to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The US is imposing fresh sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities </strong>over Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said.

Joe Biden told Zelenskiy that “it’s an honour to be by your side” and promised he “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/21/volodymyr-zelenskiy-joe-biden-us-washington-visit"">will never stand alone</a>” as the US president pledged continued financial, military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine. The two leaders held a joint news conference before heading to Capitol Hill to address a joint session of the US Senate and House of Representatives.</p></li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>In an address to Congress, Zelenskiy said Ukraine “will never surrender” as he</strong> <strong>reiterated how his country and the US “are allies in this battle”</strong>. “Next year will be a turning point, the point when Ukrainian courage and American resolve will guarantee Ukrainian freedom, the freedom of people who stand for their values,” Zelenskiy said. “The Russian tyranny has lost control over us,” he added. “Against all odds and doom and gloom, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> didn’t fall. Ukraine is alive and kicking.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy also sought to</strong> <strong>persuade Republican lawmakers to continue to fund his country’s defence against Russia.</strong> “Your money is not charity. It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way,” he said.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>The Kremlin said US supplies of Patriot missile systems to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a>, announced during the visit of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to Washington on Wednesday, would not contribute to settling the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, and would not prevent Russia from achieving its goals. </strong>In a call with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there had been no signs of readiness for peace talks during Zelenskiy’s visit, and this was evidence the US was fighting a proxy war with <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"">Russia</a> “to the last Ukrainian”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy met with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday while returning to Ukraine from the US. </strong>Ukraine’s president posted a photo of the meeting on his Telegram and said the pair “summed up the year, which brought historic challenges due to a full-scale war”. The two spoke “for a long time, almost two hours”, according to an aide for President Duda.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has visited army units fighting in Ukraine, state media cited the ministry as saying. </strong>Shoigu visited Russian units deployed to the “area of the special military operation”, the state-owned news agency Ria reported, using Moscow’s term for the conflict in Ukraine. It did not specify where the visit took place.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russia’s chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said the frontline in Ukraine was stable. </strong>In an end-of-year message delivered to foreign military attaches and published by the defence ministry, Gerasimov said Moscow had concentrated its forces on “completing the liberation” of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>A fire broke out on Russia’s only aircraft carrier on Thursday, Russian state media reported. </strong>The <strong>Admiral Kuznetsov,</strong> a flagship of the Russian navy, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-tells-us-congress-aid-is-not-charity-biden-announces-185bn-package-including-patriot-air-defence-missiles?page=with:block-63a454288f08c23d9f5d6062#block-63a454288f08c23d9f5d6062"">suffered a “minor” fire</a> while docked at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in the Arctic port of <strong>Murmansk</strong>, located in the far north-west of Russia, according to reports by the Russian state-owned Tass and Ria Novosti news agencies.<br></p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>A former Russian deputy prime minister and a pro-Moscow official were injured when Ukrainian forces shelled the eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, Russian news agencies said.</strong> Donetsk, controlled by pro-Moscow troops, is in the industrial Donbas region, the centre of recent bitter fighting between Russia and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a>.<br></p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said that recent military manoeuvres were not aimed at <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> and dismissed “conspiracy theories” about deployments of Belarusian armed forces at the border. </strong>Speaking at a conference of military leaders marking the end of snap military inspections held this month, Lukashenko also said he could not rule out “aggression” against Belarus on the part of unspecified “neighbours”.<br></p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, met officials from Russia’s military and state atomic energy company, Rosatom, to discuss setting up a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. </strong>Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s chief, said more negotiations were needed after “another round of necessary discussions”. Rosatom described the talks on measures needed to safeguard the Zaporizhzhia facility and the surrounding region as “substantive, useful and frank”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The Ukrainian ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said the number of children who had been “forcibly deported” to Russia could be in the hundreds of thousands. </strong>Authorities had established <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/22/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-tells-us-congress-aid-is-not-charity-biden-announces-185bn-package-including-patriot-air-defence-missiles?page=with:block-63a44cc18f083d29b407e014#block-63a44cc18f083d29b407e014"">the identity of more than 13,000 children</a> deported to Russia, Lubinets said, adding that investigators had uncovered a cell inside a “torture chamber” in the recently liberated <strong>Kherson</strong> where children were allegedly detained and mistreated.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news"">Europe</a> to reduce its reliance on the US</strong> <strong>and develop its own defence capabilities while taking a more assertive role within Nato.</strong> Speaking to reporters on his return to Paris from a summit in Amman, Jordan, Macron stressed that he doesn’t see his push to develop European defence as an alternative to Nato.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will hold a summit with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy early next year, </strong>according to an EU spokesperson. The summit will take place on 3 February but its location has not yet been determined.<br></p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The White House has pledged</strong> <strong>a new $1.58bn aid package</strong> <strong>to Ukraine and will send advanced <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/20/us-patriot-missiles-war-ukraine-nato-defence-system"">Patriot missile batteries</a> </strong>to the war-torn country, saying the assistance will be vital to stop Russia’s “barbaric” rocket attacks on critical infrastructure. Zelenskiy told a White House news conference that the weapons were “the only way that we can deprive the terrorist state of its main instrument of terror – the possibility to hit our cities, our energy”. In a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned that continued western arms supplies to Ukraine would lead to a “deepening” of the conflict. The US has already supplied $22bn in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February.</p></li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>The Biden administration also unveiled new curbs on technology exports to Russia’s Wagner military group</strong>. The group, a private military contractor with close ties to the Kremlin, will now be labelled a military end-user and face tough new curbs on access to technology made anywhere in the world with US equipment. The US under-secretary of commerce for industry and security, Alan Estevez, said the group was “actively committing atrocities and human rights abuses across Ukraine”.</p></li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/21/vladimir-putin-promises-army-anything-it-asks-for-as-invasion-enters-11th-month"">pledged to give his army anything it asks for</a>, promising no financial limits</strong> on what the government would provide in terms of equipment and hardware. Speaking in Moscow after meeting with Russia’s top military officials, Putin said there were no “funding restrictions” for the military. “The country, the government will give everything that the army asks for. Everything.” Putin also gave his backing to a plan by his defence minister to boost the size of the armed forces by more than 30% to 1.5 million combat personnel.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Putin also acknowledged that the call-up of 300,000 reservists he ordered in September had not gone smoothly, </strong>the latest in a series of recent comments in which he has admitted the challenges his army is facing. “The partial mobilisation that was carried out revealed certain problems, as everyone well knows, which should be promptly addressed,” he said. The call-up drew strong criticism as new recruits were deemed to be physically unfit or too old and lacking basic equipment.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The UN will allocate an additional $20m from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund to support more than 300 civil society organisations and volunteer groups. </strong>“These groups have always been the backbone of the humanitarian response in Ukraine and even more since the war started in late February,” <a href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-coordinator-allocates-20-million-support-local-organizations-and-volunteer-groups-forefront-humanitarian-response-enruuk"">said</a> Denise Brown, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has confirmed he is on his way to the US, his first foreign trip since the war broke out 300 days ago. </strong>The<strong> </strong>US president, Joe Biden, released a statement saying that Zelenskiy will go to the White House on Wednesday before addressing a joint session of Congress “demonstrating the strong, bipartisan support for Ukraine”. A senior US administration official denied that Biden will pressure Zelenskiy to seek a diplomatic end to the war.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy’s visit to the US is “extremely significant” and will disprove Russian attempts to show that US-Ukrainian relations are “cooling”, Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said. </strong>The Ukrainian president’s trip and meeting with his US counterpart will provide an opportunity to explain the real situation in Ukraine, what weapons Kyiv needs to fight Moscow, and why it needs them, Podolyak told Reuters.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong> The Kremlin has said nothing good will come of Zelenskiy’s trip to Washington and that Russia sees no chance of peace talks with Kyiv. </strong>In a call with reporters, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that continued western arms supplies to Ukraine would lead to a “deepening” of the conflict – something that could backfire on Kyiv, he warned.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Air raid alerts were heard across all parts of Ukraine on Wednesday, according to local officials.</strong> There was no immediate word of a new wave of Russian attacks.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has vowed that Russia will fulfil all the goals of what Moscow calls its “military campaign” in Ukraine in an end-of-year meeting of his top defence officials. </strong>In his speech, where he laid his country’s military plans to defence chiefs in Moscow, Putin said he will ensure that Russia’s nuclear forces are combat-ready and that there were no financial limits on what the government would provide its military.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has called for his country’s military to be expanded from its current 1 million servicemen to 1.5 million</strong> amid the fighting in Ukraine. Speaking at an end-of-year conference with Russia’s military chiefs and Putin, also proposed raising the age range for mandatory Russian military service to cover Russian citizens aged 21-30.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has undertaken a surprise trip to Beijing and held talks with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during which he said they discussed the Ukraine conflict. </strong>Medvedev, now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, said he and Xi had discussed the two countries’ “no limits” strategic partnership, as well as Ukraine.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, will visit Russia on Thursday for discussions on the creation of a security zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine,</strong> the Russian state-owned RIA Novosti news agency reported, citing Russia’s envoy to the international institutions in Vienna.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>President Zelenskiy visited the frontline city of Bakhmut on Tuesday.</strong> He met military representatives and handed out awards to soldiers, his office has said.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>A blast ripped through the Urengoi-Pomary-Uzhhorod gas exporting pipeline that leads from Russia through <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a>.</strong> Reuters reported that three people died in the incident.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Ukraine was warned to prepare for new Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure.</strong> Prime minister Denys Shmyhal said Moscow wanted Ukraine to spend Christmas and new year in darkness.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, said the situation in four areas of eastern <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – that Moscow illegally annexed in September, was “extremely difficult”.</strong> Russia’s illegal annexation of the four territories, which together make up 15% of Ukraine, marked the largest forcible takeover of territory in Europe since the second world war and was condemned by Kyiv and its western allies as illegal. Russia has suffered acute setbacks in the areas, halting its ambitions.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, on Tuesday condemned Iran’s support for Russia in its war in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> and the ongoing repression of opposition in the country, </strong>but said the EU would continue to work with Iran on restoring the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. “Necessary meeting with Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian in Jordan amid deteriorating Iran-EU relations,” Borrell tweeted ahead of a regional conference being hosted by Jordan.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Ukraine is accelerating efforts to erase the vestiges of Soviet and Russian influence from its public spaces by pulling down monuments and renaming hundreds of streets </strong>to honour its own artists, poets, soldiers, independence leaders and others – including heroes of this year’s war. Since the war began, Ukraine’s leaders have shifted a campaign that once focused on dismantling its communist past into one of “de-Russification”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>China says Chinese-Russian naval drills beginning on Wednesday aim to “further deepen” cooperation between the two countries whose unofficial anti-western alliance has gained strength since Moscow’s invasion of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a></strong>. The drills will be held off the coast of Zhejiang province south of Shanghai until next Tuesday, according to a brief notice posted Monday by China’s eastern theatre command under the ruling Communist party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy</strong><strong> said Russia’s new strategy to destroy Ukraine’s infrastructure would not weaken the country’s resolve to liberate all occupied land</strong>, describing the conflict, in an interview with the Financial Times, as a “war of strength and resilience” and pushing back against western fears of escalation.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>In his address late on Thursday, Zelenskiy said</strong><strong>: “Together we endured nine months of full-scale war and Russia has not found a way to break us, and will not find one</strong><strong>.”</strong> He also accused Russia of incessantly shelling Kherson, the southern Ukrainian city that it abandoned earlier this month.

 <li><p><strong>Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko provoked ire in Ukraine by suggesting that the end of the war is Ukraine’s responsibility</strong>, and that if it does not “stop”, it will end in the “complete destruction” of the country.

 <li><p><strong>The </strong><strong>MoD said Russian soldiers are likely to have suffered heavy casualties</strong> while digging “ambitious” trench systems near the town of Svatove in the Luhansk oblast while under heavy artillery fire.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) boss, Rafael Grossi, said none of the blasts had been “critical” for nuclear safety and security. But he said that whoever was behind the attacks, “it must stop immediately”, adding: “You’re playing with fire.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine and Russia blamed each other for the attacks </strong>The Ukrainian operator of the nuclear power plant said on Telegram that Russian forces were behind “targeted” shelling on Saturday night and Sunday morning.

He added it would mean that a country “that recovers its territories must capitulate to the country that is losing”. The comments come after recent US media reports that some senior officials were beginning to encourage Ukraine to consider talks.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Nearly 45,000 criminal proceedings have been initiated over crimes allegedly committed by Russian service personnel</strong> during the invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian national police have said.

The incident is the first time that the territory of a Nato country has been struck during the near-nine-month Ukraine war.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Russian defence ministry has claimed that on Tuesday it had not targeted anywhere within 35km (22 miles) of the Ukraine-Poland border</strong>. In a statement reported by Tass the ministry said: “Statements by various Ukrainian sources and foreign officials about allegedly ‘Russian missiles’ falling in the village of Przewodów are a deliberate provocation with the aim of escalating the situation”. The Russian ministry claimed to have identified the wreckage as a Ukrainian S-300 from photographs.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine is requesting “immediate access” to the site of the explosion in eastern Poland, a senior Ukrainian defence official said. Oleksiy Danilov,</strong> secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, said Ukraine wanted a “joint study” of Tuesday’s incident with its partners. He added that Kyiv expected its allies to provide the information that provided the basis for their conclusions that the incident may have been caused by Ukraine’s air defences.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Jens Stoltenberg</strong>, secretary general of Nato, says the Polish missile incident demonstrates that the war in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> “which is Putin’s responsibility – continues to create dangerous situations”. Nato is “constantly” assessing its presence in the eastern part of the alliance, he said, adding “At the same time, we have no indication that this was a result of a deliberate attack on Nato territory. And we have no indications that Russia is planning offensive military actions against the Nato allies.”</p></li> <li><p>UK prime minister <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong> has blamed <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>’s “cruel and unrelenting” war for destabilising the world economy, while calling for Nato allies to wait for the results of “a full investigation into the circumstances behind missiles falling in Poland yesterday”. The British PM and his Canadian counterpart <strong>Justin Trudeau</strong> spoke with Ukraine’s president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong>, and said in a read-out afterwards that “whatever the outcome of that investigation [into the explosion in Poland], Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is squarely to blame for the ongoing violence.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>A senior adviser to Ukraine’s president said on Wednesday that Russia was to blame for any “incidents with missiles” after its invasion of his country. </strong>“In my opinion, it is necessary to adhere to only one logic. The war was started and is being waged by Russia. Russia massively attacks Ukraine with cruise missiles,” <strong>Mykhailo Podolyak</strong> said in a written statement. “Russia has turned the eastern part of the European continent into an unpredictable battlefield. Intent, means of execution, risks, escalation - all this is only Russia. And there can be no other explanation for any incidents with missiles.”</p></li> <li><p>Turkey’s president <strong>Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</strong> said he is satisfied with Russia’s claim that it was not involved in the incident in Poland, and that “insisting that the missiles were Russian-made will provoke this issue.”</p></li> <li><p>Former Russian president and hawkish long-term ally of Putin, <strong>Dmitry Medvedev</strong>, has said that the explosion on Polish territory showed the west was moving closer to another World War. “The incident with the Ukrainian-alleged ‘missile strike’ on a Polish farm proves just one thing: waging a hybrid war against Russia, the west moves closer to world war,” Medvedev wrote on Twitter.</p></li> <li><p>Italy’s prime minister <strong>Giorgia Meloni</strong> expressed “great apprehension and concern” over the missile explosion, adding she was meeting with Nato and European allies to consider possible steps.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A draft declaration from G20 leaders said “most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine”, demanding Russia’s “complete and unconditional withdrawal” from its neighbour’s territory. </strong>The reference to war is a rejection of Russia’s claim that it is involved in a “special military operation”. But it also said “there were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions”, reflecting the divisions among <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/g20"">G20</a> states over Russia.

 <li><p>US president <strong>Joe Biden</strong> and his Chinese counterpart <strong>Xi Jinping</strong> have reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war “should never be fought” in a long-awaited meeting in Bali earlier today, the White House said. The pair shook hands in front of the US and Chinese flags ahead of the three-hour meeting on the resort island and “spoke candidly” about a range of issues, including key regional and global challenges, the White House said in a statement.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>China</strong>’s read-out from the meeting differed slightly, with the New York Times reporting that “Unlike the White House’s account, the Chinese account did not mention Xi and Biden agreeing on opposing Russia’s threat of using nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war.”</p></li> 
 <li><p>In remarks to the media after his meeting with China’s president, <strong>Joe Biden</strong> said that Kherson is a significant victory for Ukraine. Biden said it is hard to tell at this point what the victory will mean, but that the US will continue to support Ukraine. He said he is confident that Russia will not occupy Ukraine as they intended.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russian forces destroyed key infrastructure in Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson before retreating, Zelenskiy had said in his nightly address.</strong> Russia troops “destroyed all the critical infrastructure: communications, water, heat, electricity” he said in his latest national address. Kherson’s mayor said the humanitarian situation was “severe” because of a lack of water, medicine and bread. Zelenskiy said authorities had dealt with nearly 2,000 mines, trip-wires and unexploded shells left by Russian troops.</p></li>

<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>Ukrainians hailed Russia’s retreat from Kherson</strong> as Kyiv said it was working to de-mine the strategic southern city and restore power across the region. In the formerly occupied villages of Pravdyne and Snihurivka, outside Kherson, returning locals <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/13/i-cant-stop-smiling-residents-welcome-ukrainian-troops-in-the-frontline-town-of-snihurivka"">embraced returning troops</a> and their neighbours, some unable to hold back tears. “Victory, finally!” one said.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The head of Kherson’s regional state administration said everything was being done to “return normal life” to the area.</strong> Speaking from Kherson city in a video poster to social media, Yaroslav Yanushevych said that while de-mining was carried out, a curfew had been put in place and movement in and out of the city had been limited. <strong>Zelenskiy added that 226 settlements in the Kherson region will be restored</strong>, encompassing more than 100,000 local residents. Ukraine can “feel the approach of our victory” he added in his latest national <a href=""https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/usi-mi-vzhe-vidchuvayemo-yak-nablizhayetsya-nasha-peremoga-z-79109"">address</a>.</p></li> 
 <li><p>According to Russian media sources, the Ukrainian army has entered the city of <strong>Herois’ke,</strong> in the Kinburn Peninsula in the southern part of Kherson, following an amphibious operation, as heavy fighting continues across the region.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/13/mines-looting-no-power-kherson-assesses-damage-after-russian-retreat"">accused Russian soldiers of war crimes</a> and killing civilians in Kherson</strong>. “Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered,” he said on Sunday.</p></li> 
 <li><p>A pro-Russian tank gunner who was accused of firing into residential buildings in the Ukrainian port city of <strong>Mariupol</strong> has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason, according to Ukraine’s state security service (SBU). The pro-Russian militant, nicknamed “Phil”, had fired “at least 20 shots at residential high-rise buildings in Mariupol”, the SBU said in a statement.</p></li> 
 <li><p>There was confusion after it was reported that Russia’s foreign minister <strong>Sergei Lavrov</strong> had been hospitalised after arriving in Bali for the G20 summit. Foreign ministry spokesperson <strong>Maria Zakharova</strong> dismissed the claim as “the height of fakery”, and posted a video of Lavrov sitting reading documents at his hotel. In the video Lavrov says “This is a kind of game that is not new in politics. Western journalists need to be more truthful – they need to write the truth”. However, the governor of Bali said that while Lavrov was in good health, he had been in hospital for a check-up.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The White House has confirmed that the CIA director, <strong>William J Burns,</strong> was in Ankara in Turkey on Monday to speak with his Russian counterpart. A White House official said Ukraine was briefed in advance about the visit, that Burns was not conducting any kind of negotiations, and he was conveying a message on the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, and the risks of escalation to strategic stability.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The EU’s top diplomat has said Ukraine will decide when to enter talks with Russia, amid growing speculation that western capitals will pressure Kyiv into negotiations. Josep Borrell</strong>, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, said: “Ukraine will decide what to do. Our duty is to support them”.

 <li><p>Ukraine’s foreign minister <strong>Dmytro Kuleba</strong> and US secretary of state <strong>Antony Blinken</strong> met at the ASEAN summit in Cambodia. “There were very few who believed that Ukraine would survive,” Kuleba said. “This is coming, and our victory will be our joint victory – a victory of all peace-loving nations across the world”. Blinken hailed the “remarkable courage” of Ukraine’s military and people and vowed that US support “will continue for as long as it takes” to defeat <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"">Russia</a>.

The president said he would not be proposing a specific timeframe for any extension of the grain corridor deal – which expires at the end of next week – but said he wants it to run “as long as possible”.</p></li>

<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>On Wednesday the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu had ordered troops to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/russians-destroy-dnieper-bridges-to-slow-ukraine-advance-on-kherson"">leave Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson</a>,</strong> the only regional capital Moscow had captured since the invasion began. The announcement marks one of Russia’s most significant retreats and a potential turning point in the war. General <strong>Sergei Surovikin</strong>, in overall command of the war, called it a “very difficult decision”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>While Russia did not formally declare it was abandoning Kherson, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/ukraine-brigade-russia-retreat-kherson-frontline"">all signs point to a Moscow retreat</a>. </strong>“Kherson cannot be fully supplied and function,” Surovikin said. “The decision to defend on the left bank of the Dnipro is not easy, at the same time we will save the lives of our military.” Russia had been <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/as-russia-tries-to-dig-in-ukraines-challenge-will-be-to-repeat-its-victory-in-kherson"">preparing its exit for the last month,</a> moving command and control across the river.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Ukraine’s army chief, <strong>Valeriy Zaluzhnyi</strong>, said Kyiv could not yet confirm whether Russia was indeed pulling out of the city, but that Ukrainian troops had advanced seven kilometres (four miles) in the past 24 hours and recaptured 12 settlements.</p></li>

 <li><p>Ukrainian victory in Kherson will be a <strong>significant blow to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin,</strong> only weeks after a high-profile ceremony in Moscow in which he announced the “forever” annexation of the Kherson region along with three other regions.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Ukraine</strong> <strong>reacted with caution, saying some Russian forces were still in Kherson</strong> and additional Russian manpower was being sent. “Until the Ukrainian flag is flying over Kherson, it makes no sense to talk about a Russian withdrawal,” said <strong>Mykhailo Podolyak</strong>, a senior adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Joe Biden said Russia’s withdrawal of troops from Kherson was “evidence” that its military had “real problems”. </strong>During a White House press conference on Wednesday, the US president said he “knew for some time” it would happen.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Ukrainian</strong> media has reported that the <strong>Mykolaiv</strong> oblast is now free of Russian troops.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The <strong>UK </strong>prime minister, <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, spoke to the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy,</strong> on Thursday morning, where they agreed that the Russian withdrawal from the occupied city of Kherson would represent “strong progress” for Ukraine’s forces.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Russia’s loss of Kherson’s west bank will likely prevent its forces from achieving their strategic aspiration of a land bridge reaching Odesa, according to the <strong>UK Ministry of Defence. </strong>“With limited crossing points, Russian forces will be vulnerable in crossing the Dnipro River,” the latest British intelligence report reads.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Russia’s retreat was “part of an overall pattern” demonstrating that Moscow “has absolutely lost the momentum”</strong>. “But we should not underestimate Russia, they still have capabilities,” he told Sky News. “We have seen the drones, we have seen the missile attacks. It shows that Russia can still inflict a lot of damage.”</p></li> 
 <li><p>Russia’s decision to withdraw troops from near the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson is a positive step, Turkish President <strong>Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</strong> said.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>Italy</strong> says it has not ruled out new measures to provide further military support for Ukraine but these are not on table at the moment, defence minister <strong>Guido Crosetto </strong>told Il Messaggero daily.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The <strong>US reportedly will not give <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> advanced drones in order to avoid an escalation with Russia</strong>, according to the Wall Street Journal. Kyiv has pleaded for the weaponry for months. The Biden administration’s decision reflects the limit of the kinds of weaponry Washington is willing to provide for Ukraine’s defence, the WSJ noted.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Putin</strong> may only take part in the upcoming summit of the G20 group of nations in Bali via video link, Russian state news agency RIA said on Thursday, citing the Russian embassy in Indonesia. <strong>Zelenskiy</strong> is also due to appear via video.</p></li>

Russia accused Ukraine of an act of “sabotage”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s military said</strong> <strong>Russia was urging</strong> <strong>residents of Kherson to evacuate as soon as possible, sending them warning messages on their phones</strong> <strong>on Sunday.</strong> Russia was “occupying and evacuating” Kherson simultaneously, trying to convince Ukrainians its force are leaving when in fact they are digging in, Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern forces, told state television. The Kremlin-installed administration in Kherson already has expelled tens of thousands of civilians from the city.</p></li> <li><p>Serbia’s president, <strong>Aleksandar Vučić</strong> has said he expects the battle of Kherson to be the defining battle of the war. Russian state-owned news agency Tass quoted him saying: “We have a difficult time ahead of us, next winter will be even more difficult than this one, because we are facing the Battle of Stalingrad, the decisive battle in the war in Ukraine, the battle for Kherson, in which both sides use thousands of tanks, aircraft, artillery. The west thinks that in this way it will be able to destroy Russia, Russia believes that in this way it will be able to protect what it took at the beginning of the war and bring the war to an end. This will create additional problems everywhere.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia’s defence ministry took the unusual step of denying reports by Russian military bloggers that a naval infantry unit had lost hundreds of men in a fruitless offensive in eastern Ukraine, the state-owned RIA news agency said. </strong>It said the ministry had rejected the bloggers’ assertions that the 155th marine brigade of the Pacific Fleet had suffered “high, pointless losses in people and equipment”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine continues to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/06/ukraine-motivational-messaging-maintains-morale-as-winter-bites"">brace for fresh Russian attacks</a> on its energy infrastructure</strong>. Russia “is concentrating forces and means for a possible repetition of massive attacks on our infrastructure, primarily energy”, said <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong>, the Ukrainian president. Ukraine faced a 32% deficit in projected power supply on Monday, said <strong>Sergei Kovalenko</strong>, CEO of Yasno, a major supplier of energy to the capital. “This is a lot, and it’s force majeure,” he said.

If it comes to it, we’ll have to move them back to west west of Ukraine, Lviv and all the places closer to the European Union. That’s a huge number of people to be located but Ukrainian winters can become quite harsh. We have to think how we do it.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Maksym Kozytskyi</strong>, governor of <strong>Lviv</strong>, one of Ukraine’s westernmost regions, has announced preparation measures for receiving more refugees and internally displaced people into his region, and appealed for help with the provision of diesel generators and financial aid for medical supplies.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine has received its first delivery of Nasams and Apside air defence systems, the country’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, announced Monday. </strong>“We will continue to shoot down the enemy targets attacking us.

 <li><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has declared martial law in the four provinces of Ukraine where it controls territory</strong> after Russian officials warned of a looming Ukrainian assault on the key southern city of Kherson. The law, published on the Kremlin website, gives far-reaching emergency powers to the Russian-installed heads of <strong>Luhansk</strong>, <strong>Donetsk</strong>, <strong>Zaporizhzhia</strong> and <strong>Kherson</strong> provinces, which Russia recently proclaimed as annexed after sham referendums.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Putin also ordered an “economic mobilisation” in eight provinces bordering Ukraine</strong>. The measures apply to the southern regions of <strong>Krasnodar, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk </strong>and<strong> Rostov,</strong> which are all near Ukraine, and the territories of <strong>Crimea</strong> and <strong>Sevastopol,</strong> which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. Putin said he was granting additional authority to the leaders of all Russian provinces to maintain public order and increase production in support of Moscow’s war, which is entering its eighth month.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The Russian-installed leader of the occupied Ukrainian region of <strong>Kherson</strong>, said Wednesday that authorities plan a mass removal of 50-60,000 people over the next six days. <strong>Vladimir Saldo</strong> said authorities were moving civilians to the left bank of the Dnipro in order to “keep people safe” and allow the military to “act resolutely”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Kirill Stremousov</strong>, the Russian-installed deputy administrator of the Kherson region, echoed the message on Telegram late on Tuesday: “The battle for Kherson will begin in the very near future. The civilian population is advised, if possible, to leave the area of the upcoming fierce hostilities.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Andriy Yermak</strong>, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, described the Russian announcements as “a propaganda show”. He said “The Russians are trying to scare the people of Kherson with fake newsletters about the shelling of the city by our army, and also arrange a propaganda show with evacuation”. He described it as “a rather primitive tactic, given that the armed forces do not fire at Ukrainian cities – this is done exclusively by Russian terrorists”.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>Nearly a third of Ukraine’s power stations have been destroyed by Russian drone and missile attacks in the past eight days, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said, as his office warned of a “critical” power situation nationwide.</strong> Zelenskiy accused <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"">Russia</a> of engaging in “terrorist attacks” affecting a significant proportion of the country’s critical infrastructure and wreaking havoc on electricity and other utility supplies.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Kyrylo Tymoshenko</strong>, the deputy head of the presidential office, said energy infrastructure and power supply were targeted overnight in an eastern district of Kyiv, where two people were killed, and in the cities of <strong>Dnipro</strong> and <strong>Zhytomyr</strong>.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Two “objects of critical infrastructure” were damaged in <strong>Kyiv</strong>, said the city’s mayor, <strong>Vitali Klitschko</strong>, and electricity and water supply in “many houses” in west Kyiv was “partially limited”.

 <li><p>Russia has been targeting Ukraine with a mixture of missiles and, more recently, Iranian-made <strong>Shahed-136</strong> drones, rebranded as <strong>Geran-2</strong> by the attackers. Iran denies supplying the drones to Russia, while the Kremlin spokesperson, <strong>Dmitry Peskov</strong>, said he did not have any information about their origin. “Russian equipment with Russian names is being used,” Peskov said.</p></li>

He identified two other victims as “a young couple, a husband and wife who were expecting a child. The woman was six months pregnant”. Another person is under the rubble, he added.

 <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Sunday a “very severe” situation persists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, </strong>with the “most difficult” fighting near the town of Bakhmut. The attacks came as Russia’s war in Ukraine nears the eight-month mark.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Pro-Kremlin officials on Sunday blamed Ukraine for a rocket attack that struck the mayor’s office in Donetsk,</strong> a city controlled by the separatists, while Ukrainian officials said Russian rocket strikes hit a town near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, among other targets.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>More than 30 settlements across Ukraine have been hit by Russian strikes in the last day,</strong> according to the Ukrainian military. Two schools in the southern Zaporizhzhia region were reportedly destroyed in the strikes, which targeted civilian areas.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The Ukrainian military said the estimated number of Russians killed since the start of the war has reached 65,000. </strong>Sunday morning’s update from the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said the death toll had risen by 300 over the last 24 hours.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>Russia is “probably incapable of producing advanced munitions at the rate they are being expended”,</strong> according to the latest update from the UK Ministry of Defence. The ministry said attacks like those launched across <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> on 10 October, in which Russia fired over 80 cruise missiles, represent a “further degradation of Russia’s long-range missile stocks, which is likely to constrain their ability to strike the volume of targets they desire in future”.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>The death toll from Monday’s Russian missile attacks on a swathe of Ukrainian cities has risen to 19 people, with over 100 wounded, according to figures from the Ukrainian state emergency services.</strong></p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Strikes continued on Tuesday. An attack on the Lviv region in western <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> on Tuesday left parts of the city without electricity.</strong> Governor <strong>Maksym Kozytskyi</strong> has said “At this moment, it is known about three explosions at two energy facilities in the Lviv region”.

 <li><p><strong>The head of GCHQ has said the UK spy agency has not seen any indicators that Russia is preparing to use a tactical nuclear weapon in or around Ukraine despite recent bellicose statements from <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin"">Vladimir Putin</a>.</strong> Jeremy Fleming, speaking on Tuesday morning, said it was one of GCHQ’s tasks to monitor whether the Kremlin was taking any of the preliminary steps needed before a tactical weapon was being made ready.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Fleming</strong> is expected to say in a rare public speech delivered later on Tuesday that <strong>Putin</strong> is making strategic errors due to unconstrained power. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it’s clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming will say. “With little effective internal challenge, Putin’s decision-making has proved flawed”</p></li>

 <li><p>The deployment of a joint task-force of Russian and Belorussian troops within Belarus poses a threat to Ukraine’s supply lines in the north of the country, according to <strong>Vadym Prystaiko</strong>, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Prystaiko</strong> also said that Russia is “running out of sophisticated weapons” and using missiles like “dumb bombs”, and said that Ukraine was still making progress on the frontline but “not as spectacular as it used to be a couple weeks ago”. He said in the south “we are closing the circle” and that “there are almost 20,000 Russian soldiers there. If you manage to capture them it will be a huge blow for the whole campaign.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya</strong>, leader of the democratic opposition in <strong>Belarus</strong>, has called on Russian soldiers to leave the country.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Belarus</strong> could face more sanctions if it gets more and more involved in the Ukraine conflict, <strong>France</strong>’s foreign affairs minister <strong>Catherine Colonna</strong> told French radio</p></li> 
 <li><p>A spokesperson for the <strong>UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</strong> (OHCHR) has said “We are gravely concerned that some of the attacks appear to have targeted critical civilian infrastructure … indicating that these strikes may have violated the principles on the conduct of hostilities under international humanitarian law.”</p></li> 
 <li><p>Mass bombardments of Ukrainian cities by Russia constitute war crimes under international law, the presidents of the <strong>Bucharest Nine</strong> group of countries, accompanied by the presidents of <strong>North Macedonia</strong> and <strong>Montenegro</strong>, said on Tuesday.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Thérèse Coffey</strong>, deputy prime minister of the UK, said Monday’s strikes showed “this is a time for other countries to continue the level of support that they’ve been showing, and where necessary to escalate their level of support directly to the Ukrainian armed forces.”</p></li> 
 <li><p>The German chancellor has attempted to make reassurances that the country’s energy supply will be secure this winter. <strong>Olaf Scholz </strong>said: “I am happy to say to you today, if we all continue to adapt to the changed situation – the citizens, the companies and the politicians – then we will get safely through this winter.”</p></li> 
 <li><p>Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, <strong>Sergiy Kyslytsya</strong>, has called Russia a “terrorist state” at a General Assembly meeting on Monday night. Russia’s ambassador to the UN, <strong>Vassily Nebenzia</strong>, in turn accused Ukraine of rivalling “the most outrageous terrorist organisations” after a bridge linking Russia to the annexed Ukrainian territory of Crimea was attacked.</p></li>

The city council secretary, Anatoliy Kurtev, said rockets struck the city overnight, and that at least 20 private homes and 50 apartment buildings were damaged. At least 40 people were admitted to hospital and dozens more were being treated for moderate to light injuries, Kurtev posted on his Telegram channel.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed that those who ordered and issued the “merciless” strikes in </strong><strong>Zaporizhzhia will be held responsible.</strong> In a post on his Facebook page, he said the attack was “evil” and that everyone involved in the incident “will be held accountable”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The blasts that killed at least 12 people in Zaporizhzhia came from six missiles launched in Russian-occupied areas of the wider region, the Ukrainian air force has said.</strong> The Zaporizhzhia region is one of four <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"">Russia</a> claimed as its own this month, but the regional capital remains under Ukrainian control.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Reuters reports that the White House said it would continue to arm <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> but declined direct comment on an explosion that damaged Russia’s road-and-rail bridge to Crimea.</strong> National security spokesman John Kirby told ABC’s This Week programme: “We don’t really have anything more to add to the reports about the explosion on the bridge.

The looting and destruction of cultural sites has caused losses estimated in the hundreds of millions of euros, the minister added.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine has recaptured more than 1,170 sq km (450 sq miles) of land in its southern Kherson region since launching the start of its counter</strong><strong>assault against Russia in late August, a military spokesperson said. </strong>Ukraine achieved success with its offensive in the north-east, but its drive in the south to wipe out a Russian foothold on the west bank of the vast Dnieper<strong> </strong>River has taken longer, Reuters reports.

Military experts say Russia is at its weakest point, partly because of its decision not to mobilise earlier and partly because of massive losses of troops and equipment.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Ukraine has extended its area of control in the Kherson region</strong> <strong>by six to 12 miles</strong>, according to its military’s southern command. Zelenskiy confirmed the recapture of the villages of Novovoskresenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka, saying the settlements were “liberated from the sham referendum and stabilised,” in an address on Wednesday. Kherson region’s Moscow-appointed governor, Kirill Stremousov, said the withdrawal was a tactical “regrouping” to “deliver a retaliatory blow”. The extent of Russia’s retreat remains unclear.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Moscow’s forces have left behind smashed towns</strong> <strong>once under occupation and, in places, mass burial sites and evidence of torture chambers.</strong> In <strong>Lyman</strong>, which was retaken by Ukrainian forces on Sunday, more than 50 graves have been found, some marked with names, others with numbers, the Kyiv-based outlet Hromadske reported on Wednesday.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Leaders of 44 European countries on Thursday in <strong>Prague</strong> will send a clear signal of Russia’s isolation and try to create a new order without Moscow, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, <strong>Josep Borrell,</strong> has said this morning. “The meeting is looking for a new order without <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"">Russia</a>,” he told reporters.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russia has submitted preliminary objections to a genocide case against Moscow brought by Ukraine</strong>. The International Court of Justice, which is the UN’s highest court for disputes between states, has tweeted that it had received the objections on 3 October, but these have not been made public. The filing signifies a change in Moscow’s attitude to the ICJ case. Russia is now engaging with the court, whereas it has previously skipped hearings and not filed documents directly.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The UN has warned Russia’s claimed</strong> <strong>annexation of Ukraine territory will only exacerbate human rights violations. </strong>Christian Salazar Volkmann, said UN experts had documented “a range of violations of the rights to life, liberty and security” and warned the situation would only worsen as Russia pushes forward with the annexation of some Ukrainian regions.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Attempts to play down retreats in Ukraine are no longer washing inside Russia with the latest military failures spilling on to local television screens.</strong> “Why do we advance metre by metre when they advance village by village?” Olga Skabeyeva, the country’s top state-TV host, asked a Russia-appointed official in Luhansk in a recent broadcast. Pro-war military bloggers and journalists are also <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/05/attempts-to-play-down-retreats-ukraine-russia-war-kremlin-military-failure"">criticising the Kremlin</a> and painting a bleak picture of deteriorating Russian morale. Roman Saponkov, a prominent war correspondent, described his despair over the pullback in Kherson on his Telegram channel: “I really don’t know what to say to you. The retreat … is catastrophic.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Poland says it has asked to have <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/05/poland-us-nuclear-wars-russia-putin-ukraine"">US nuclear weapons based on its territory</a></strong>, amid growing fears that Putin could resort to using nuclear arms in Ukraine. The request from the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, is widely seen as symbolic and appears to be the latest example of nuclear signalling to deter Putin. The White House, however, said it had not received such a request.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The car bombing that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/21/daughter-of-putin-ally-alexander-dugin-killed-in-car-bomb-in-moscow-reports"">killed Darya Dugina</a>, the daughter of prominent Russian political figure Alexander Dugin, was allegedly authorised by elements within the Ukrainian government</strong>, according to US intelligence sources who spoke with the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/05/us/politics/ukraine-russia-dugina-assassination.html?"">New York Times</a> and CNN. The United States took no part in the attack, either by providing intelligence or other assistance, the officials said.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has announced a partial mobilisation in Russia in a significant escalation that places the country’s people and economy on a wartime footing.</strong></p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The president also threatened nuclear retaliation, saying that Russia had “lots of weapons to reply” to what he called western threats on Russian territory and added that he was not bluffing.</strong> In a highly anticipated televised address, Putin said the “partial mobilisation” was a direct response to the dangers posed by the west, which “wants to destroy our country”, and claimed the west had tried to “turn Ukraine’s people into cannon fodder”.</p></li> 
 <li><p>“Military service will apply only to citizens who are in the reserve, especially those who have served in the armed forces, have certain military professions and relevant experience,” Putin said. Shortly after the president’s announcement, the country’s defence minister, <strong>Sergei Shoigu</strong>, said 300,000 Russians “with previous military experience” would be called up. According to the decree signed by Putin on Wednesday, the contracts of soldiers fighting in Ukraine will be extended until the end of the partial mobilisation period.</p></li> 
 <li><p>The Ukrainian presidential adviser <strong>Mykhailo Podolyak</strong> said Putin’s decision to announce a partial mobilisation was a “predictable step” that highlights that the war was not going according to the Kremlin’s plan.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Putin’s speech was swiftly condemned by western leaders. Germany’s vice-chancellor, <strong>Robert Habeck</strong>, said Russia’s decision to announce a partial mobilisation was “another bad and wrong step from Russia”. British defence secretary <strong>Ben Wallace</strong> said: “Putin’s breaking of his own promises not to mobilise parts of the population and the illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine are an admission that his invasion is failing”. Putin is making a “very dangerous nuclear gamble” and must “stop such reckless behaviour”, warned European Commission spokesperson <strong>Peter Stano</strong>.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Putin’s decision to announce a partial mobilisation sent shockwaves across Russia. </strong>Since the start of the invasion on 24 February, the Russian president has sought to shield his population from the grim realities of war, with the Kremlin eager to cultivate a sense of normality on the streets of Moscow and other major cities. But with the decision to announce a partial mobilisation and the call-up of 300,000 mostly young Russian men, the war will now enter the household of many families across the country.</p></li>

Zelenskiy will speak to the UN general assembly by video-link on Wednesday.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The White House rejected Russia’s plans to hold the referendums, </strong>adding that Moscow may be making the move to recruit troops in those areas after suffering extensive losses on the battlefield. Jake Sullivan, president Joe Biden’s national security adviser, called the referendums an affront to principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Several world leaders</strong> <strong>have said they will not recognise any referendums or new annexations of Ukrainian territory</strong>, with French president Emmanuel Macron calling the plan a “parody”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Any referendums on joining <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"">Russia</a> in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories would destroy any remaining window for talks between Kyiv and Moscow, Ukrainian publication Liga.net cited the Ukrainian president’s office spokesman as saying on Tuesday. </strong>“Without the referendums, there is still the smallest chance for a diplomatic solution.

 <li><p><strong>The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said on Tuesday evening that its operations in Donetsk near the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka</strong> <strong>caused Russia to suffer “significant losses”.</strong> But Russian forces shelled those towns and dozens more in north-eastern and southern Ukraine, the general staff said.</p></li>

Luhansk’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, said Ukraine’s armed forces were in “complete control” of <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bilohorivka,+Luhansk+Oblast,+93310/@48.927134,38.1171685,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x41200c585773dbe1:0x8961fec000b5c05c!8m2!3d48.926456!4d38.2459006"">Bilohorivka</a>. “It’s a suburb of Lysychansk. Soon we will drive these scumbags out of there with a broom,” he said. “Step by step, centimetre by centimetre, we will liberate our entire land from the invaders.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>The pace of Ukrainian forces’ advance in the north-east had thrown Russian forces into a “panic”</strong>, Ukraine’s president said in his nightly address. <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong> said he was now focused on “speed” in liberated areas. “The speed at which our troops are moving. The speed in restoring normal life,” he said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukrainian forensic experts have so far exhumed 146 bodies, mostly of civilians, at </strong><strong>a mass burial site near Izium in </strong><strong>the east of the country</strong>, the regional governor said on Monday. Oleh Synehubov, the governor of the Kharkiv region, said the exhumed bodies included two children. The Kremlin has denied allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province.</p></li> <li><p>The pro-Russian separatist self-proclaimed <strong>Donetsk People’s Republic</strong> (DPR) has said 10 civilians were killed and 15 wounded overnight by shelling from Ukrainian forces on the territory that the DPR occupies. Officials of the similarly self-proclaimed separatist <strong>Luhansk People’s Republic</strong> have informed the Russian news agency Tass that seven people were killed, including three children, in the village of Krasnorichenske, which it occupies.</p></li> <li><p>Ukraine’s armed forces have <strong>sunk a barge carrying Russian troops and equipment across the </strong><strong>Dnieper River</strong> near Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region, the Kyiv Independent reports.</p></li> <li><p>Security fears have almost certainly led Russia’s <strong>Black Sea </strong><strong>fleet </strong>to relocate its kilo-class submarines from <strong>Sevastopol in Crimea </strong>to<strong> </strong><strong>Novorossiysk </strong><strong>in southern Russia</strong>, the UK Ministry of Defence says in its latest intelligence briefing on the war.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The British prime minister </strong><strong>is expected to vow to match the UK’s spending on military support to Ukraine next year at the same level as this year when she speaks at the UN general assembly. </strong>Liz<strong> </strong>Truss told reporters as she travelled to New York: “Ukraine’s victories in recent weeks have been inspirational. My message to the people of Ukraine is this: the UK will continue to be right behind you every step of the way.

Ukrainian president later involved in car crash in Kyiv but not seriously hurt","<ul> <li><p>The major city of<strong> Kryvyi Rih</strong> struggled to contain <strong>damage to its water system from Russian missile attacks.</strong> The largest city in central Ukraine, with an estimated pre-war population of 650,000, was <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/15/ukraine-city-of-kryvyi-rih-floods-after-russian-missile-strikes-hit-dam"">targeted by eight cruise missiles on Wednesday</a>, officials said. The missile strikes hit the Karachunov reservoir dam. “The water pumping station was destroyed. The river broke through the dam and overflowed its banks. Residential buildings are just a few meters away from the river,” Ukrainian legislator <strong>Inna Sovsun</strong> said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Oleksandr Vilkul</strong>, the head of the Krivyi Rih military administration, said in a post on Telegram that 112 homes were flooded but that works to repair the dam on the Inhulets river were under way, and that “flooding was receding”. He added that water levels had “dropped considerably” and that there were no casualties.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dmytro Kuleba</strong>, Ukraine’s foreign minister, called the attack on the Kryvyi Rih hydraulic structures “a war crime” and “an act of terror”. “Beaten by Ukrainian army on the battlefield, Russian cowards are now at war with our critical infrastructure and civilians,” Kuleba said. “Russia is a terrorist state and must be recognised as such.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was involved in a traffic accident in Kyiv last night, but he is not seriously hurt</strong>, his spokesperson said in a Facebook post early on Thursday. Serhii Nykyforov, who did not say when the accident occurred, said Zelenskiy’s car had collided with a private vehicle. “The president was examined by a doctor, no serious injuries were found,” he said, adding the accident would be investigated. Medics accompanying Zelenskiy gave the driver of the private car emergency aid and put him in an ambulance, he said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>In his nightly televised address, video of which was posted shortly after the accident, Zelenskiy said he had <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/14/volodymyr-zelenskiy-makes-surprise-visit-to-newly-recaptured-city-izium-ukraine"">just returned from the area around Kharkiv</a></strong>, adding that “almost the entire region is de-occupied” after a lightning counteroffensive to dislodge Russian troops. “It was an unprecedented movement of our soldiers – the Ukrainians once again managed to do what many thought was impossible,” he said. After visiting the liberated city of Izium, Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s troops had recaptured around 8,000 sq km (3,100 square miles) of territory.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Kirill Stremousov</strong>, one of the Russian-imposed leaders of the occupied <strong>Kherson</strong> region of Ukraine, has claimed that about 120 Ukrainian soldiers were killed while trying to enter Kherson region in the south of Ukraine via the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinburn_Spit"">Kinburn Spit</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Should the US decide to supply Kyiv with longer-range missiles, that would cross a “red line” and the US would then become “a party to the conflict”</strong>, Russia’s foreign ministry said Thursday. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> is already using US-made high mobility artillery rocket systems – just not US-made longer-range missiles.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Rail services will resume between Kharkiv and Balakliia</strong> in Kharkiv oblast on Thursday. Workers have already repaired bridges and dozens of damaged tracks after Balakliia was liberated on 8 September.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine has continued to consolidate control of the newly liberated Kharkiv region</strong>, the UK Ministry of Defence says in its latest briefing. The update said some Russian forces appeared to have fled the Ukrainian troops’ advance “in apparent panic”, leaving behind key equipment.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s defence ministry found what its officials believe to be a “torture chamber”</strong> used by Russian troops to hold Ukrainian prisoners in the city of<strong> </strong>Balakliia. While some Balakliia residents <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/13/balakliia-residents-take-stock-after-ukraine-recaptures-frontline-town"">told the Guardian </a>that they had little interaction with the Russian forces, who mostly stayed on edges of the town, and did not experience the scenes of torture and execution seen elsewhere in the country, Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the Kharkiv region national police investigation department, said that 40 people had been detained during the occupation. One resident told the BBC that he was held by Russians in the city’s police station for more than 40 days and was tortured with electrocution.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s state border guard service rescued five teenagers who had been locked in a basement for seven days by Russian troops</strong> in the recently liberated city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region. The teenagers, four girls and a boy aged 15 to 17, are all students of the same educational institute.

I would be lying if I would say it could happen soon,” Guterres said, adding: “I have no illusion; at the present moment the chances of a peace deal are minimal.” Even a ceasefire was “not in sight”, he said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Kremlin sources “are now working to clear Putin of any responsibly of the defeat,</strong> instead blaming the loss of almost all of occupied Kharkiv oblast on under-informed military advisers”,<strong> </strong>according to the US-based think-tank Institute of the Study of War. In a statement reported by CNBC, the institute said that “Kremlin officials and state media propagandists are extensively discussing the reasons for the Russian defeat in Kharkiv oblast, a marked change from their previous pattern of reporting on exaggerated or fabricated Russian successes with limited detail”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Putin still believes he was right to launch an invasion of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a>, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said</strong> on Wednesday after a 90-minute telephone call with the Russian president.<strong> </strong>“Sadly, I cannot tell you that the impression has grown that it was a mistake to begin this war,” Scholz said in a press briefing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Germany has delivered four more Gepard anti-aircraft guns and 65 refrigerators to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a></strong>, the German government announced on Wednesday.

Today, when we look up, we are looking for only one thing – the flag of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a>,” Zelenskiy said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy said about 8,000 sq km (3,100 square miles) have been liberated so far, apparently all in the north-eastern region of Kharkiv.</strong> “Stabilisation measures” had been completed in about half of that territory, Zelenskiy said, “and across a liberated area of about the same size, stabilisation measures are still ongoing”. Ukraine now has set its sights on freeing all territory occupied by invading Russian forces.</p></li> <li><p><strong>While the mood is joyous over the recent gains the Ukrainian military, officials understand the challenges that lie ahead in the newly liberated territories</strong> – many of which had been living under Russian occupation for almost the entirety of the invasion. Much of the city of Izium was destroyed, and the people were terrorised. Investigators are now beginning to look into possible war crimes committed by Russian soldiers.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych</strong> held out the prospects of building on the gains made over the weekend in the Kharkiv region by moving on the eastern province of Luhansk. “There is now an assault on Lyman and there could be an advance on Siversk,” Arestovych said. The pro-Russian leader of the <strong>Donetsk People’s Republic</strong> denied the claims and said in a video post that Lyman remains in their hands, saying “the situation has been stabilised.”</p></li> <li><p>However, the frontline in eastern Ukraine is approaching the borders of territory claimed by the self-proclaimed pro-Russian separatist <strong>Luhansk People’s Republic</strong> (LPR) according to <strong>Andrey Marochko</strong>, a senior LPR military commander.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces warned that Russian forces were continuing to loot as they withdrew from occupied territories.</strong> On a stretch of highway heading into Russian territory, Ukrainian officials spotted civilian vehicles with licence plates from the Kharkiv region, driven by Russian military and weighed down with looted belongings. In the south, there were reports of Russian occupants breaking the gates of private garages and taking cars, as well as removing furniture.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia has probably used Iranian-made uncrewed aerial vehicles in Ukraine</strong> for the first time, Britain’s defence intelligence said on Wednesday, after Kyiv reported downing one of the UAVs – a Shahed-136 – on Tuesday. The device is a “one-way attack” weapon, the MoD said, and has been used in the Middle East. The shooting down of the drone near the frontline in Ukraine suggests that <a href=""https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/russia"">Russia</a> is using the weapons as a tactical weapon rather than a strategic one targeting military installations deeper into Ukrainian territory.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russian forces have ordered that the mobile Internet be cut off in the Russian-occupied Luhansk oblast Wednesday</strong>, Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk oblast, said on Telegram.</p></li> <li><p><strong>One person was killed and a number more injured by Russian shelling in the Zaporizhzhia oblast in southern Ukraine over the past two days</strong>, according to the regional state administration.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Five civilians were killed and 16 more wounded in Bakhmut in the Donetsk oblast yesterday</strong>, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the Donetsk oblast. The region has seen heavy fighting in the past day, Kyrylenko said, with Russian troops attacking infrastructure “with tanks, mortars and artillery”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Western sanctions on Russia are having a real impact and are there to stay, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Wednesday, stressing that the European Union’s solidarity with Ukraine would be “unshakeable”. </strong>“This is the time for us to show resolve, not appeasement,” she said. “We are in it for the long haul.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Von der Leyen also sent a strong signal over European Union expansion</strong>, saying the European Union is not complete without <strong>Ukraine</strong>, <strong>Moldova</strong>, <strong>Georgia</strong> and western Balkan countries. “You are part of our family, you are the future of our union. Our union is not complete without you,” she said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russian oil and gas revenues have fallen to their lowest for almost a year</strong>, despite a big rise in prices.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Pope Francis</strong>, at a summit of religious leaders in Kazakhstan, has said that God does not guide religions towards war in what appears to be an implicit criticism of Russian Orthodox <strong>Patriarch Kirill</strong>, who has backed the invasion of Ukraine.</p></li> <li><p><strong>US president Joe Biden said it was hard to tell if Ukraine had reached a turning point</strong> in the six-month war. Asked about the situation on Tuesday, he said: “It’s clear the Ukrainians have made significant progress,” he said. “But I think it’s going to be a long haul.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>The White House said the United States is likely to announce a new military aid package for Ukraine in “coming days”</strong>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Kremlin has given a lukewarm reaction to the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/13/long-term-military-investment-proposed-as-alternative-to-ukraine-joining-nato"">draft set of security guarantees</a> published by the Ukrainian President’s office Tuesday. </strong>Co-authored by the former Nato secretary general, <strong>Anders Fogh Rasmussen</strong>, and Volodomyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, <strong>Andrey Yermak</strong>, the report said Ukraine’s allies should commit to legally binding large-scale weapons transfers and multi-decade investment in the country’s defences, as an alternative to Kyiv’s long-term aspirations to join Nato. On Wednesday Kremlin spokesperson <strong>Dmitry Peskov</strong> said <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"">Russia</a> viewed the document negatively, saying the idea of Ukraine joining Nato was “the main threat to Russia”.

President <strong>Maia Sandu</strong> visited three towns where Ukraine suspects Russian forces of committing atrocities. “This shouldn’t happen. And, you know, it is heartbreaking to see what we see here and to hear the stories. Ukraine and Moldova need help. We want this war to stop, this Russian aggression against Ukraine to be stopped as soon as possible. We want to stay part of the free world.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>The US is likely to announce this week the purchase of an advanced medium- to long-range surface-to-air missile defence system for Ukraine. </strong>Washington is also expected to announce other security assistance for Ukraine, including additional artillery ammunition and counter-battery radars to address needs expressed by the Ukrainian military.</p></li> <li><p>Ukraine’s foreign minister, <strong>Dmytro Kuleba</strong>, said <strong>G7 countries should respond</strong> to the latest missile strikes by <strong>imposing further sanctions on Russia and providing more heavy weapons</strong> to Ukraine.</p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy"">Zelenskiy</a> urged Belarusians to stand in solidarity with Ukraine. </strong>“Russian leadership wants to drag you into the Ukraine-Russian war because it doesn’t care about your lives.

 <li><p><strong>Satellite images show Russian forces are getting closer to Kyiv, with the bulk of ground forces now about 25km from the centre of the capital, </strong>according to the UK’s latest defence intelligence report.<strong> </strong>They appear to be firing artillery towards residential areas. Air raid sirens were sounding in Kyiv in the early hours of Saturday morning. Russian forces bombarded cities across the country on Friday and appeared to be regrouping for a possible assault. Media in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> reported that two oil depots near Kyiv were on fire after Russian attacks, one in the town of Vasylkiv which is also home to a large airbase and has <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/vasylkiv-why-this-small-ukrainian-town-is-now-a-big-russian-target"">become a major Russian target</a>.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russia has warned that </strong><strong>it now considers arms shipments to Ukraine as “legitimate targets” for the military. </strong>The comments by the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, are likely to raise fears over a potential escalation in the conflict in Ukraine.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The Russian army has suffered its biggest losses in decades, according to Volodymyr Zelenskiy. </strong>The Ukrainian president claimed 31 Russian battalion tactical groups have now been rendered incapable of combat and said 500 to 600 Russian troops surrendered on Friday. He insisted any negotiations with Russia must begin with a ceasefire, as he accused the west of insufficient involvement in peace talks and urged <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia"">Russia</a> to uphold the agreement to allow evacuations from the besieged port city of Mariupol.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, spoke to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.</strong> They echoed Zelenskiy’s call for a ceasefire as a condition for structured negotiations, but a French presidency official said Putin did not appear ready to end the war.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Zelenskiy also accused Russia of hiring “murderers from Syria” after the Kremlin ramped up efforts to bring in reinforcements from the Middle East. </strong>Syria’s military has begun recruiting troops from its own ranks to fight alongside Russian forces in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a>, promising payments of $3,000 a month – a sum up to 50 times a Syrian soldier’s monthly salary.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>The strength of Ukraine’s resistance “continues to surprise’ Russia,” a British intelligence report has said, </strong>despite attempts by invading troops to break Ukrainian morale by targeting populated areas.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The Ukrainian military said its forces had been “fighting fierce battles to maintain certain borders” in its daily operational report. </strong>It claimed Russian troops had been “demoralised” and were in an “extremely low moral and psychological state” due to the resistance of the Ukrainian people, the general staff of the armed forces said.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>US president Joe</strong> <strong>Biden</strong> <strong>spoke with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong>, to discuss ongoing efforts to impose sanctions on Russia and speed up US military, humanitarian and economic assistance. The White House said during the call the pair also discussed <strong>talks between Russia and</strong> <strong>Ukraine</strong>, but offered no additional details.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Zelenskiy also <strong>spoke to SpaceX and Tesla boss</strong> <strong>Elon Musk, </strong>announcing the country will <strong>receive more of its Starlink satellite internet terminals</strong> this coming week.</p></li> 
 <li><p>US-based credit card giants <strong>Visa</strong> and <strong>Mastercard</strong> have announced they will suspend their Russian business operations.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Britain’s prime minister</strong> <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> has issued a six-point plan in reaction to Russia’s invasion of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> and is urging other leaders to endorse it in efforts to ensure Russia fails in its apparent attempt to take over its democratic neighbour.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, has told the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, </strong>that Beijing opposes any moves that “add fuel to the flames” in Ukraine. Wang called for negotiations to resolve the immediate crisis, adding that the US and Europe should pay attention to the negative impact of Nato’s eastward expansion on Russia’s security. Blinken said the world is acting in unison in response to Russian aggression and ensuring that Moscow will pay a high price.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Blinken briefly stepped onto Ukrainian soil</strong> for a meeting with the <strong>foreign minister, Dymtro Kuleba</strong>, who predicted Russia would be defeated but appealed for more military assistance. Blinken also visited a welcome centre set up by Polish authorities where about 3,000 refugees are taking shelter.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Hundreds of men have been lining up in Kyiv to join the Ukrainian army.</strong> One volunteer, Volodymyr Onysko, told Sky News: “We know why we are here. We know why we defend our country. And our guys that are actually standing there and fighting Russian military forces. We know what we are doing and that’s why we will win.”</p></li> 
 <li><p>The <strong>Ukrainian military</strong> said Russian forces continue to focus on <strong>Kyiv</strong> while moving ahead with assaults on <strong>Kharkiv, Mykolaiv</strong> and the creation of a land corridor with Crimea, in its <strong>latest operational <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/265782555734830"">report</a>.</strong> The report said aircraft from airports in Belarusian territory were involved in air strikes on military and civilian infrastructure in Kyiv and Zhytomyr.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russia has dropped powerful bombs on residential areas of Chernihiv</strong>, a city north of Kyiv, according to a regional official. Vyacheslav Chaus posted a photo of what he said was an undetonated FAB-500, a Soviet-designed 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) air-dropped bomb of the kind usually used against military-industrial facilities and fortified structures.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>Russian troops have seized Europe’s largest nuclear plant at </strong><strong>Zaporizhzhia</strong><strong> </strong>after a fire sparked by heavy shelling, Ukrainian authorities said. No changes in radiation had been recorded but any loss of ability to cool nuclear fuel would lead to “significant radioactive emissions” that could “outgrow all previous nuclear power plant accidents”, they said.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, offered to travel to Ukraine </strong>to facilitate talks with Russia aimed at guaranteeing the safety of nuclear plants during the conflict. The situation “continues to be extremely tense and challenging,” he said.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has warned the days to come are “likely to be worse”, </strong>calling<strong> </strong>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “the worst military aggression in Europe for decades”. But he stressed Nato was a “defensive alliance” and not seeking a war with Russia.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Stoltenberg said foreign ministers discussed a “no-fly zone” over Ukraine </strong>but agreed that Nato planes should not operate over Ukrainian airspace. He also said Nato had evidence Russia was using cluster bombs.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>In a call with Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz,</strong> <strong>the Russian president, Vladimir Putin dismissed</strong><strong> as “propaganda fakes” </strong>reports of missile strikes on large cities. He said Russia was open to dialogue but only if its demands – the neutral, non-nuclear status of Ukraine, its “denazification”, recognition of Crimea as Russian and the “sovereignty” of separatist territories in eastern Ukraine – were met.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Putin, also warned Russia’s neighbours “not to escalate the situation”</strong> by imposing more restrictions on his country, adding: “There are no bad intentions towards our neighbours … We fulfil all our obligations and will continue to fulfil them.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russian forces intensified their bombardment of cities in eastern and southern Ukraine</strong> after taking control of Kherson on Thursday, causing devastating damage. Mariupol remains encircled, Russian soldiers entered Mykolayiv, and Kharkiv, the country’s secojnd city, was again heavily shelled.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>US secretary of state Anthony Blinken said Washington was “committed to doing everything we can</strong> to make this stop”, adding that the west was “faced together with what is President Putin’s war of choice: unprovoked, unjustified, and a war that is having horrific, horrific consequences for real people.”</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>More than 1.2m people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries </strong>since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February, the UN said, including about half a million children.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed directly to Russians to protest</strong> over the seizure of nuclear power infrastructure by Russian troops. “Russian people, I want to appeal to you: how is this possible?” he said. “After all, we fought together in 1986 against the Chernobyl catastrophe.”</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>In a separate televised address, Putin made many of the same points</strong>, also claiming the “special military operation” was going according to plan and hailing his soldiers as heroes. He said without evidence that Ukrainian troops had tortured and killed Russian prisoners of war and were using human shields.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>After a second round of talks, both sides agreed to create humanitarian corridors</strong> to evacuate civilians, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said. “In those places where the corridors themselves will be located, it will be possible to cease fire for the duration of the evacuation,” he said.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Russian forces are in control of both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port</strong> <strong>Kherson, </strong>local authorities said, while the port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov is also reportedly surrounded by Russian troops and without power, heating or water, the city council said</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>With the Black Sea port of Odesa also preparing for an amphibious assault</strong>, analysts believe Russia is implementing a plan to cut Ukraine off from the sea and create a land corridore from its border westwards to Romania.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>The death toll so far in the Russian invasion of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine"">Ukraine</a> is at least 198, according to the Ukrainian health ministry. </strong>Three children are among those dead. The ministry’s head was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying 1,115 people had been injured, including 33 children.</p></li>

 <li><p><strong>Russia’s former president, Dmitry Medvedev, </strong><strong>said Russia could cut diplomatic ties with the west. </strong>The Russian RIA news agency reported that the senior lawmaker Andrei Klimov said Russia would decide in which areas it would work with the west and where it no longer made sense to cooperate.</p></li>
