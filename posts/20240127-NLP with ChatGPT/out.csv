"Welcome to the Public Accounts Committee on Monday 22 January 2024. Today, we are looking at the defence equipment plan, which is something that the Ministry of Defence publishes every year. It sets out the spending and the capability requirements of the Ministry of Defence over the next decade that our Armed Forces need to operate. This latest plan is £16.9 billion over budget over that 10-year period. That is the largest deficit since the MoD first published the plan. It is a big difference from last year's plan, with costs having risen by nearly £66 billion.",1,Q1,Chair,"Public Accounts Committee meeting, defence equipment plan, Ministry of Defence, spending, capability requirements, Armed Forces, budget, deficit, MoD, plan, costs",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 4.
"For a lot of us, it feels a bit like groundhog day as we come back and look at this challenge every year. It is quite right that we look at it over a 10-year period, but it is, nevertheless, a somewhat depressing picture. Some of the reasons for that, which we will go into, are around inflation and other costs, but we need to get to the bottom of what is happening and how the Ministry of Defence will work to bridge that gap.",2,Q1,Chair,"- Groundhog day feeling

"I am delighted to welcome our witnesses. We have David Williams, Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Defence; Tom Wipperman, director of strategic finance and investment approvals at the Ministry of Defence; Andy Start, chief executive of defence equipment and support, often referred to as DE&S; and Lieutenant General Robert Magowan, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff, who is responsible for financial and military capability. A very warm welcome to you all.",3,Q1,Chair,"witnesses, introductions",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as an 8.
"Before we go into our main session, we have just a couple of quick questions about other matters that might affect defence.",4,Q1,Chair,"main session, quick questions, other matters, affect defence",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a neutral 5.
"Good afternoon, everyone. Mr Williams, I am going to ask a question about the Port Talbot steel closures and what assessment you have made of the possible impact that this will have on defence manufacturing going forward.",5,Q2,Sarah Owen,"Port Talbot steel closures, assessment of impact on defence manufacturing.","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 8 on the scale. The tone is professional and polite, indicating a neutral to slightly positive sentiment."
"I have not yet reviewed any impact from the recent announcement. We do, however, take the security and sustainability of our supply chain seriously, including access to raw materials. As the Committee knows, the Department intervened just over a year ago to support Sheffield Forgemasters, so it is an area in which we are interested. To the extent that there are wider Government conversations on a response to the announcement, I would expect the Ministry of Defence to be engaged as an interested party, but I have not been involved in that.",6,Q2,David Williams,"1.

Are there any projects or specific programmes that are likely to be affected? What will happen with the shortfall of materials that is going to be needed? What are the possible options available to us with the closure of Port Talbot steelworks?,7,Q3,Sarah Owen,"projects/programmes affected, shortfall of materials, options with closure of Port Talbot steelworks","The sentiment expressed in the paragraph is neutral, as it consists of inquiries and does not express a clear positive or negative opinion. Therefore, it would be rated as a 5 on the sentiment scale."
"Mr Start may want to come in on this. The supply of steel is, in the first instance, a matter for our prime contractors who are producing equipment for us. I have not had any specific impacts from the Tata announcement flagged to me yet, but I am happy to take that away and write to the Committee, if that would be helpful.",8,Q3,David Williams,"- Inquiry about Mr. Start's input

The speaker seems open to addressing any potential concerns and shows willingness to take action, but does not express any significant excitement or positivity."
"That would be great. Tata Steel UK currently provides high-tech steel to UK defence for engine and gearbox components on fixed-wing and rotary aircraft, and for hatch covers on armoured personnel carriers and nuclear submarines, so it would be great if we could get the specifics on those.",9,Q4,Sarah Owen,"- Tata Steel UK

"Good afternoon. That is a smart tie, Mr Start. Mr Williams, on Saturday, Larisa Brown, the excellent defence editor of The Times, had a front-page splash entitled, ""Army numbers to drop below 70,000 'in two years'"". This is germane to an examination of the equipment plan, because, as you well know, unless you have suitably qualified and experienced personnel---SQEP, as the military calls them---to maintain your kit and keep it working, you can spend all the money that you want on very expensive equipment, and some of it in this plan is incredibly expensive, but, if you cannot maintain it, it is no good to anybody. It could be a ship left on the harbour wall, a tank in the tank park, or an aircraft that is a hangar queen. What are you doing to stop the absolute haemorrhaging of people leaving the Armed Forces?",11,Q5,Mr Francois,"- Mr Start's smart tie

"The projection in that article is one from recent trends rather than our plan. It is an issue that all three services and the Department are taking seriously. Our approach is a combination of a range of short-term measures to increase attraction and retention. Some of that involves proposals around financial incentives, for example, as well as longer-term initiatives, including recommendations from the Haythornthwaite review from last summer about how we think about patterns of service and zigzag careers, and make sure that we are accessing the skills that we need.",12,Q5,David Williams,"- Projection in article

"People coming in and out of service, yes.",14,Q6,David Williams,People coming in and out of service,"Without any additional context or content to base the sentiment on, it is difficult to accurately rate it on the scale. This sentence seems neutral and does not convey a specific sentiment. As a result, it can be rated around 5, indicating a neutral sentiment."
"Mr Williams, I am sorry to cut across you, but, as you are well aware, there is never enough time in these sessions, so apologies for keeping this tightly focused. At the moment, across all three services, people are leaving the Armed Forces at a ratio of three people leaving for every one who joins. I deliberately use the analogy of the National Health Service, where my wife works, but that is the equivalent of the patient bleeding out on the operating table. You cannot maintain that for long. If you do, you will have operational failure, because you will not have enough skilled personnel to make it work. What you have said is all very well, but I and the Committee detect no sense of urgency. They are leaving at a rate that you cannot sustain. What are you doing to stop the bleed?",15,Q7,Mr Francois,"- Apologies for time constraints

"You are right that outflow is higher than inflow. On any numbers, that is the situation. I can assure the Committee that it is being taken very seriously. There is lots of ministerial interest in how the services are addressing this issue. It is probably the number one risk that we are routinely engaging with in senior management fora in the Department. There is a set of individual initiatives that each service is taking, as well as us, in thinking through those broader pay, attraction and retention measures.",20,Q8,David Williams,"outflow, inflow, situation, Committee assurance, ministerial interest, services addressing, number one risk, senior management fora, Department, individual initiatives, broader pay, attraction and retention measures.",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 7.
"For brevity, I will have one more go and then hand back. The Army is one example, but it is not just the Army. According to policy, it is going to reduce to 72,500 within the next couple of years. According to this article, it will be at 70,000 in two years. If you extrapolate the trend at which they are leaving, David, by the end of 2026, it will be at 68,000. If you extrapolate the line forward to a decade's time, it will be at 52,000, meaning that, as a graphic example, you could fit the entire regular British army in the Etihad stadium. Some of them are Man U supporters who will not like that. This really is a crisis.

"I get that. The numbers that you set out for where the trained strength of the Army would be by those dates is not our plan. I acknowledge that our current plan is not working in the way that we want. I am happy to pass your request about a statement back to Ministers. All I would say is that---and I am trying to think whether I have said this to this Committee before or to your sister Defence Select Committee---if I think about the risks that keep me awake in defence, the number one risk to delivering our programme is access now and over time to the right number of people in and not in uniform, with the skills that we need.",24,Q10,David Williams,"- Trained strength of the Army

"General Magowan, you were looking for the figures there, and I wondered whether you had any update.",26,Q11,Chair,"General Magowan, figures, update","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as around a 5. It does not contain an overtly positive or negative sentiment, but rather a neutral inquiry about the status of the figures."
"Our figures are five to eight rather than one to three, but that is by the bye. We accept the problem.

"The only thing that I would add is that trends change, and can do so quite quickly, particularly around strategic events, which can be either a positive or a negative for recruiting, so I will leave it at that.

"This is something that we look at in other sessions as well, as does our sister Committee. We want to look at the equipment plan and the affordability of it, and the simple question, Mr Williams, is this.

"As you set out, Chair, the excess on our current assumptions over budget over the 10-year period is just under £17 billion. Just to put that in context, that is around a 6% overall excess on a baseline budget assumption of just under £290 billion. There are two principal drivers of that change. One is the impact of adverse economic conditions, particularly the impact of extraordinary inflation, which has added around £11 billion to the cost of the programme as we previously envisaged that to be. Together with movement on foreign exchange rates of a couple of billion pounds, that is the bulk of the net increase.",30,Q12,David Williams,"excess on current assumptions over budget, 10-year period, overall excess, baseline budget assumption, principal drivers of change, impact of adverse economic conditions, impact of extraordinary inflation, cost of programme, movement on foreign exchange rates, net increase.",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 3.
"We have also taken a decision linked to the context of the dangerous world in which we find ourselves, consistent with the integrated review and with the defence command paper, to seriously de-risk the nuclear enterprise in defence by ensuring that it is fully funded and de-risked, and so there has been a substantial increase in the cost of the nuclear enterprise over that period as well.",31,Q12,David Williams,"- Decision linked to the dangerous world

"As we may come on to, I would describe this equipment plan as, effectively, a work in progress. We drew a line under it at the end of March 2023. There is more to be done on ensuring not only that the programme is affordable but that there is clarity on assumptions around budget, around the costs and around the content of the programme.",32,Q12,David Williams,"equipment plan, work in progress, line under it, end of March 2023, programme affordability, clarity on assumptions, budget, costs, content of the programme",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"At the moment, the spending review is scheduled for November of this year, but we will come to that later, because there are a number of uncertainties around that. You have this shortfall of nearly £17 billion. As you say, some of those pressures such as inflation and forex are difficult to control, but you are going to have to manage that shortfall nevertheless, so it is a balance between capability or efficiencies. How are you going to approach that? We stress that it is over a 10-year period, so there is front-loading and back-loading that you can do, but we have seen problems before when you have just moved issues to the right. Can you assure us that you are not going to do that, and what are you going to do to try to shrink the gap?",33,Q13,Chair,"- Spending review schedule for November

"Let me say this in as reassuring a way as I can. One of the uncertainties that we are dealing with is the timing of the Government's commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. On Monday last week, the Prime Minister said in the House that the timing and trajectory would be a matter for the next spending review. We are keen not to cut, defer or de-scope capability programmes unnecessarily in advance of clarity around that budget. That is one of the reasons why, in the material that we set out to the Committee, we talk about an upside and downside budget scenario.",34,Q13,David Williams,"uncertainties, timing of Government's commitment to increase defence spending, next spending review, capability programmes, budget scenario","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.5. It is neither very negative nor very positive, but rather expresses a level of uncertainty and caution."
"As inflation changes, the forward costs over a 10-year programme will change as well. Inflation is coming down, so some of the assumptions about the costs of the programme in the later years will reduce.",35,Q13,David Williams,"inflation changes, forward costs over a 10-year programme, assumptions about costs of the programme in the later years",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
You still have the increase that you have had in recent years.,36,Q14,Chair,increase in recent years,I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"We still have the increase that we have had in recent years, and we are currently in the middle of a force design process, looking at the capabilities that we want to commit to. Some of those will be from the programme of record that we already have, as set out in this document, but we also want to reflect some of the new challenges and the learning set out in our defence command paper last summer, partly through lessons from Ukraine and partly around the pace of technological change.",37,Q14,David Williams,"increase in recent years, force design process, capabilities, programme of record, new challenges, learning from Ukraine, pace of technological change",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 7.
"We are going to touch on capabilities in more detail in a moment. You have the gap in the equipment plan. You are saying you are going to wait until the spending review before making decisions about the 2.5%. Whether or not that happens, you are waiting. In the meantime, there are no real plans to cut projects and, if there are any that are not really going to deliver, they are going to keep costing money. Even if everything else is benign---you get an increase in defence spending, inflation decreases and a few other things work in your favour---there will still be a shortfall. Is there any realistic work going on about cutting or reducing a programme?",38,Q15,Chair,"capabilities, equipment plan, spending review, 2.5%, cut projects, costing money, increase in defence spending, inflation decreases, shortfall, cutting or reducing a programme",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 3.5.
"There is work underway right now, which is really looking at this problem in two parts. First, what are we going to do for the financial year 2024-25, maybe into 2025-26, and, secondly, what are our capability priorities across the 10-year period overall? Those are two somewhat different questions. It may well be that we need to take measures against existing programmes to manage through the first couple of years of that pressure. We have more choice when it comes to the decisions that we make over the 10-year period in terms of contractual commitment, although it starts higher and then tails off. Over the 10-year period, we are currently only about 25% on contract, so there is quite a lot of choice in the later years of the 10-year planning horizon about where we want to invest.",39,Q15,David Williams,"- Work underway

So you are deferring the choices about making hard decisions.,40,Q16,Chair,"deference, choices, making hard decisions",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 4.
"We are deferring some choices where there are no-regrets decisions. For example, one of the key lessons from Ukraine is that we need to invest more in our munitions stockpiles. We will get on with that in advance of the next spending review. We are doing that already and, no doubt, we can talk a bit about that in this session.",41,Q16,David Williams,"deferment of choices, no-regrets decisions, lessons from Ukraine, investment in munitions stockpiles, next spending review",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"The point is about not stopping things unnecessarily over the next 12 to 18 months, if it turns out that we are going to have funding headroom for it. What that means is quite an important focus on commitment control. As we are going through the approvals and putting new programmes on to contract, there is then a decision about being confident that we want those in the forward programme, come what may, given the budgetary and costing scenarios that we face. If not, we then take a decision on a case-by-case basis about whether it makes most sense to defer that programme.",42,Q16,David Williams,"funding headroom, commitment control, approvals, new programmes, contract, forward programme, budgetary and costing scenarios, defer programme",7
"We are going to get into a long answer here. There are lots of words, but we are going to drill down on some of the capability issues a little later. A colleague will be picking up on those. One of the things about this report is that, when it came out, the Department's public statement did not sound like it agreed with the National Audit Office's take on this, which is well worked up. Can you just be clear that it is an agreed report?",43,Q17,Chair,"- Getting into a long answer

"It is an agreed report, and it is based on data that we shared with the National Audit Office. We worked closely with it on the production of the report. The distinction---and it is not a criticism of the NAO work but almost having set it an impossible task---is that we did not publish our own equipment plan this year, because of the uncertainty of how we would deal with inflation and the opportunity to think about new capabilities that we want in light of the defence command plan. That is why I described it as a work in progress. There are a set of issues that we still need to work through.",44,Q17,David Williams,"- Agreed report

There is more to come.",45,Q17,David Williams,"NAO analysis, approach taken every year, view based on a set of data, still interim, more to come","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6. The tone is mostly neutral, with a slight hint of optimism at the end (""There is more to come"")."
"I am going to drill down a little further on the Chair's questioning. You are holding everything in this 10-year defence plan, knowing that it is unaffordable. Is this a deliberate ploy to put pressure on the Treasury to give you that 2.5% more quickly than it would otherwise wish to?",46,Q18,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"Chair's questioning, 10-year defence plan, affordability, deliberate ploy, pressure on Treasury, 2.5% increase","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 3.    
The tone of the statement leans negative as it criticizes the Chair for knowingly holding an unaffordable defence plan. The implication of using a deliberate ploy to pressure the Treasury also adds a negative connotation."
"No, not directly. The point is simply that, if you are looking to plan with a degree of precision over a 10-year period, it is helpful to know what your budget is. I have certainty about my budget only for the next 15 months before we are into the next spending review, so it is based on a set of assumptions.",47,Q18,David Williams,"budgeting, planning, precision, 10-year period, certainty, next 15 months, spending review, assumptions",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.

"There will then be a debate for 2025-26. My point is that the Government's stated position is that, as economic and fiscal circumstances allow, the defence budget is going to increase. The core assumption here does not factor that in. My colleagues may correct me, but the upper scenario for our defence budget assumes growth towards 2.5% from 2027 through to 2032, but that is just an assumption from us.",51,Q19,David Williams,"2025-26 debate, Government's stated position, increase in defence budget, core assumption, colleagues' correction, upper scenario for defence budget, growth towards 2.5%, assumption",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"The point that the Chair was trying to make is that, without prejudging whether the Chancellor is going to give you that 2.5%, the content of this defence plan is unaffordable. Therefore, the responsible thing to do---and, indeed, any budget holder in any other Department would be widely criticised if they did not do this---would, surely, be to make a priority list and take out those items that were not an absolute priority. Otherwise, you are holding items in there, spending money, planning staff, working out budgets and everything else. You might then have to cancel them much later in the day, which would lead to very poor value for money for some of the other matters that remained in. You would get better value for money if you took out those that were not priorities, would you not?",52,Q20,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"- The affordability of the defence plan

"First, depending on the timing of a move to 2.5% of GDP, the plan could well be affordable as currently set out. That definitely does not mean that we are being complacent about managing inflationary pressure where we can. We are going through that process, and General Magowan is leading the process at the moment to review our priorities against not only affordability but the kinds of capability lessons from Ukraine and the ambition that we set out in the defence command paper refresh last summer. We are doing that and, where there is a no-regrets move to either fund or stop, my expectation is that we would enact that quickly. Where it is something that makes sense to view in the round alongside a spending review process, those are decisions that we will take when we get into that cross-Government resource allocation event.",53,Q20,David Williams,"- Timing of the move to 2.5% of GDP

"I am going to switch to you, Mr Wipperman. Good afternoon. We have limited time, so shortish answers would be really helpful. I want to talk about two aspects of the plan. It says in the NAO report that you are planning to move quite substantially to inflation-linked contracts because of the recent spike in inflation, which is now coming down. What incentive does that give to your defence contractors to keep their costs down if you do that?",54,Q21,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"switching to Mr Wipperman, limited time, shortish answers, two aspects of the plan, inflation-linked contracts, recent spike in inflation, incentives for defence contractors, keeping costs down",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"The reason why we have moved towards that policy is that, going into this period of high inflation, around 25% of our contracts were firm price, and so the suppliers were taking the inflation risk. As we have moved into very high levels of inflation and very volatile movements in inflation, the cost to us of trying to put that risk on to suppliers has been too great. The value-for-money judgment is that we get better value for money by linking to the appropriate indices---and I am happy to talk about indices in a second---that mean that suppliers are not fully exposed to that risk and that we are doing some risk sharing. Which indices we might use for any particular contract will depend on the nature of what we are buying and the materials that go towards a product.",55,Q21,Tom Wipperman,"policy, high inflation, contracts, firm price, suppliers, inflation risk, levels of inflation, volatile movements, cost, risk, value-for-money judgment, appropriate indices, risk sharing, particular contract, buying, materials, product",I would rate the sentiment expressed in this paragraph as a 6.
"One of my colleagues is going to ask about that. On the specific issue of contracts, you did not answer the second bit of my question about what incentive there is on your suppliers to keep their costs down, if you give them a full inflation-linked contract. It puts me in mind---and I am old enough to remember this---of the old cost‑plus contracts, where the MoD was well and truly ripped off by its suppliers because they knew that they could immediately pass every single increase in costs back to the taxpayer.",56,Q22,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"colleague's question, contracts, supplier incentives, cost-plus contracts, MoD, supplier rip-off, cost increases.","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 4.5. The tone is slightly negative as the person expresses concern and parallels the situation to a previous negative experience. However, it is not extremely negative, as they are simply expressing worry and questioning the potential consequences of the situation described."
"Mr Start may want to comment on the details of the contracts, because he would be closer than I, but the indices that we would use will set out a set of costs and be independent of any particular behaviours. The indices are to do with market prices and the way that things are moving. Linking it to the contract, whether it is CPI, clothing and textile indices, or RPI, will be an escalator within the contract that we would have agreed.",57,Q22,Tom Wipperman,"contracts, details, comments, indices, costs, behaviors, market prices, movement, CPI, clothing and textile indices, RPI, escalator","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. It is relatively neutral, and does not convey strong positive or negative emotions."
"Surely, it is in all of our interests to try to keep inflation down. One way to do that is to put pressure on your suppliers, and one way to do that is by an incentivised contract rather than full inflation-linked contract.",58,Q23,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"inflation, keeping inflation down, putting pressure on suppliers, incentivised contract, full inflation-linked contract",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"If I may, there is a value trade-off to be had around inflation volatility. If the inflation volatility is very high---",59,Q23,Andy Start,"value trade-off, inflation volatility",6
It has peaked and is coming down.,60,Q23,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"peak, coming down",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. Since the statement is relatively neutral and does not convey any explicit positivity or negativity.
"It is, but it is still really quite volatile. At this point, that volatility means that, at the moment, on balance, we are better off using indices rather than fixed prices. Once it is stabilised, we will probably wish to go back to fixed prices. It depends on the nature of the individual contract as to the level of incentive to the supplier within the contract. If you are on a target cost incentive fee style contract, there becomes a strong incentive for the contractor to try to keep the cost down. If you are on a more straightforward single-source contract, there is less incentive within the contract.",61,Q23,Andy Start,"volatility, indices, fixed prices, stabilisation, individual contract, level of incentive, target cost incentive fee style contract, contractor, cost, straightforward single-source contract","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 6.5. The tone is somewhat neutral, but leans more towards a positive sentiment. The speaker acknowledges the volatility but also suggests that using indices is currently better. They mention a possible return to fixed prices once the situation stabilizes, which suggests a hopeful outlook. The discussion of incentives within contracts also implies some level of positivity and potential benefits."
"Conversely, industry knows that the more it spends on a particular contract, the less there is to spend on other things. Its supply chain is not where it wants to spend the money. It wants to spend the money on generating more profit. Driving costs down and making the products that it has more exportable is more attractive, so there is an export incentive, although I would like that incentive to be stronger. That is the other dynamic that sits in this frame. It is not perfect, and every dynamic has a trade-off, but, at the moment, it is very clear to us that, if we try to cost in inflation with the level of volatility, we are just not getting good-value-for-money offers back.",62,Q23,Andy Start,"- Industry spending on contracts
- Supply chain
- Generating more profit
- Driving costs down
- Making products more exportable
- Export incentive
- Trade-off

"General, good afternoon. Can I come to you, please, on a completely different aspect? This is on how your top-level budget holders approach their budgets. Some approach it on a completely different basis to others. For example, the RAF and the Navy have unaffordable plans, because they include full predictive costs for the capabilities that Government expect them to deliver, while others, such as the Army and the strategic programmes directorate, have developed affordable plans by accepting greater risks that their capabilities will not meet Government's objectives. Does that make any sense? Surely, they should all do their budgets on the same basis. Otherwise, you cannot compare apples with apples. You are comparing apples with pears.",63,Q24,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"General, good afternoon. (General introduction)

You are comparing apples with pears. (Metaphor emphasizing the lack of comparability)","I would rate the sentiment expressed in this paragraph as a 5. It is somewhat neutral, as it presents a concern about different approaches to budgeting but does not express a clear positive or negative opinion."
"On the financial machinery, I will hand to Mr Wipperman. From the perspective of capability and the risk that we carry, it does not make any difference to me, because I can see what capabilities we need in each domain or across domains---multidomain, as we say---and whether that is costed in the programme. I compare that against the risk register that I hold, so how they report it and whether it is within or without their costed programme is not going to deflect me from understanding where the operational risk is. The machinery of the process is more in Mr Wipperman's space.",64,Q24,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"Financial machinery, capability, risk, domains, multidomain, costed programme, risk register, operational risk, process",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.5. The statement appears to be neutral to slightly positive overall.
I probably asked the question to the wrong person. I apologise.,65,Q24,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"question, wrong person, apology","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 6.5. It leans more towards a neutral sentiment due to the inclusion of an apology, indicating a turn towards a more positive tone. However, the acknowledgment of asking the question to the wrong person suggests a hint of self-doubt or annoyance, which prevents it from being a completely positive sentiment."
"To build on what the general said, the first thing that we would really want to be clear on is that we are not saying to TLBs that they can go off and do whatever they want in terms of the way they build up their budgets and plan. Through the planning round, we set them a clear set of instructions about what they need to do. We set them clear parameters---for example, the inflation, forex or pay rates that they need to use. They have to build that within their equipment plan and the rest of their budget to make sure that there is consistency.",66,Q24,Tom Wipperman,"general statement, clarification of instructions, parameters for planning, inflation, forex, pay rates, consistency",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6. The tone is neither extremely negative nor extremely positive. It seems more neutral and informative in nature.
"Where we see a difference is between the TLBs that put the cost of some projects that are within policy or within ambition in their plan and those that do not. Going back to what the Permanent Secretary said a short while ago, the plan represents a snapshot of a period in time and the capabilities that the Army knows it needs to develop came out through the DCPR work, which was undertaken after this plan closed on 31 March. Through the early part of this financial year, as we finalise the DCPR, we are now working through how we bring some of those capabilities and choices into the plan and the sorts of trade-offs that we might need to make elsewhere.",67,Q24,Tom Wipperman,"difference between TLBs, cost of some projects, policy and ambition, plan, Permanent Secretary's statement, snapshot of a period in time, capabilities that the Army needs to develop, DCPR work, plan closing on 31 March, finalizing the DCPR, bringing capabilities and choices into the plan, trade-offs",6
"Does it really? If they are doing it on a different basis, some are including the risks and some are not. How can that be fair? If I were CDS, I would be pretty miffed that others were doing it on a different basis to me and I would say, ""If they are doing it on a different basis, I am going to do it on a different basis"".",68,Q25,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"basis of comparison, inclusion of risks, fairness, different basis of decision-making","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 2. It conveys a negative and frustrated tone, suggesting a lack of fairness and potential conflict due to differing approaches."
"As the general said, we see clearly in their plans, which come back to us, the balance of financial and capability risk that they take. They are able to make different judgments within their own budgets and plans of the extent to which they want to balance those. We do not just accept what comes back to us. We are working closely with the general's teams to say, ""Are we comfortable that that balance of risk between each TLB is correct?"" In some places, we might say that we want them to take less capability risk. In others, we might want them to take financial risk. It depends on the nature of the suppliers and of the contracts that they run, and whether they have flexibility.",69,Q25,Tom Wipperman,"General's plans, balance of financial and capability risk, different judgments within budgets and plans, acceptance of what comes back, working closely with the general's teams, balance of risk between each TLB, less capability risk, financial risk, nature of suppliers, contracts and flexibility.","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the following paragraph as a 6. The overall sentiment seems slightly positive as it mentions a collaborative effort and working closely with the general's teams. However, there is also mention of potential risks and the need for balance, which slightly brings down the positivity of the sentiment."
"Could you give a precise example of each of the scenarios---one where there is more capability risk and one where there is more financial risk? We have really puzzled over why this was. When I first saw this last autumn, I could not understand it, and I still do not.",70,Q26,Chair,"Precise example of each scenario, capability risk, financial risk, puzzling situation, lack of understanding","Based on the given paragraph, I would rate the sentiment expressed as a 3."
"I will leave the machinery to Mr Wipperman. To your point, Chair, about examples, one would be between the Navy and the Army. There are elements in the plan---and we can go through those---with regard to the shipbuilding pipeline into the 2030s that are not funded and so are a pressure within the Navy. As I have discussed at various Committees, the so-called four plus one, which we can go into, sits above the line in the Army as something that is not funded, but it is outside their EP.",71,Q26,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"machinery, examples, Navy and Army, shipbuilding pipeline, funding pressure, four plus one, Army, EP",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5.
"When I look at that, there is no advantage to the Navy or the Army as to whether it is above or below the line. I know that we have to commit more to our shipbuilding pipeline into the 2030s, and we know that we have to treat some of these operational risks that we are learning from Ukraine and the so-called four plus one in the Army. The deliberation of where we are going to make decisions and where we are going to hold operational risk is not manifest in terms of the decisions that we make.",72,Q26,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"- Advantage to Navy or Army position
- Shipbuilding pipeline commitment
- Treating operational risks
- Learning from Ukraine and the ""four plus one""
- Decision-making and holding operational risk","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. It is relatively neutral, neither extremely positive nor negative."
"For me, it is partly a function of timing. As Mr Wipperman said, quite a lot of the conversations about the Army increases were discussions that we worked through after we drew a line under this equipment plan in the context of our offering into the new NATO force model---what our contribution was going to be to the strategic reserve, rapid reaction forces, regional plans and so on. There is a debate now to be had about whether the Army is funding them from within its existing programme or whether that will be money allocated to it by us.",73,Q26,David Williams,"timing, Army increases, discussions, equipment plan, NATO force model, contribution, strategic reserve, rapid reaction forces, regional plans, debate, Army funding, existing programme, money allocation",I would rate the sentiment expressed in this paragraph as a 5.
"The challenge here is partly that it is about a set of risk judgments as to where you hold the balance of capability, financial and, indeed, delivery risk in a delegated system. That is something that we are looking at as part of our review of procurement and of the operating model. It is partly about the extent to which, in that delegated model, frontline commands in particular have the authority to make changes, or whether they need to refer back to us through processes that General Rob runs.",74,Q26,David Williams,"challenge of risk judgments, capability balance, financial risk, delivery risk, delegated system, review of procurement, operating model, extent of authority, changes in frontline commands, referral process, General Rob",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 6.5.
"I have absolutely no problem in accepting the recommendation from the NAO that we should try to make this more consistent. Although we can see the line, it is an additional challenge for us, which, all things being equal, I would rather we did not have, and it does make it quite difficult for you to hold us to account.",75,Q26,David Williams,"recommendation from NAO, consistency, challenge, preference, accountability",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5.
"You have anticipated my next question. As professionals, you may well understand why it is done on a different basis, but, in terms of transparency to the general public, surely it ought to be done on a consistent basis.",76,Q27,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"anticipating a question, professional understanding, different basis, transparency to the general public, consistent basis","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.5. The overall sentiment leans more towards a positive tone, as the speaker acknowledges the professionals' understanding while also suggesting the importance of transparency to the general public."
"It would clearly make our equipment plan easier to interpret. As we think about how we reshape publication of equipment plan data for the future, views not only from the NAO but from this Committee will be most welcome. There is a question for us, notwithstanding where, formally, the numbers come out at the end of a planning round, as to whether we want to present it on a standardised basis, even if we would have to think about how we work our internal data with the NAO.",77,Q27,David Williams,"equipment plan interpretation, reshaping publication of equipment plan data, views from NAO and Committee, presenting on a standardized basis, internal data integration with NAO","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7. The overall tone is positive, as the speaker welcomes the views of the NAO and the Committee in reshaping the publication of equipment plan data. However, there is also some caution expressed about presenting data on a standardized basis and the potential challenges of working with internal data."

I think it is a yes.,79,Q28,David Williams,opinion on a topic,8
"It is just worth pointing out that paragraph 1.12 on page 19 in the NAO report highlights the Army's approach. This why I was and still am puzzled, and I am heartened that you are saying that it would be good to get the same baseline.

Some of it will be programmes that the Army will want to fund by prioritising new investment over old.",81,Q29,David Williams,"investment in ammunition stocks, DCP allocation, Army funding priorities",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"To be fair, ammunitions are to be delivered in the short term.",82,Q30,Chair,"ammunitions delivery, time frame",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. It is neutral and does not lean towards being either negative or positive.

My point is that it is quicker to deliver munitions than a new aircraft carrier.,84,Q31,Chair,"quicker delivery, munitions, new aircraft carrier",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 9.
"Not necessarily. The whole point of munitions is not what you just said, Chair, if I may say. It is about a long-term commitment to industry. We are learning, through operational lessons and not just from Ukraine, that we need a stronger industrial base. Some, but not all, of those areas will need some time to get to a level of production that is suitable for the ability to deter state-on-state conflict.",85,Q31,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"munitions, long-term commitment to industry, operational lessons, Ukraine, stronger industrial base, level of production, ability to deter state-on-state conflict",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
So we are not talking about just a few years; we are talking about a decade.,86,Q32,Chair,"time frame, duration","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. While it is not overtly positive or negative, it does convey a sense of neutrality or neutrality-leaning-towards-negative due to the emphasis on a relatively long period of time (a decade) without indicating whether it is a positive or negative thing."
"In some cases, we can go quite quickly. Mr Start is much more of an expert than I am in facing industry. For others, it is going to take a period of time, but that is the business that we are in.

"Mr Williams, I have a general question that is very germane to this. The Secretary of State recently gave evidence to the Defence Committee, where he presaged a major announcement within the next few months on big changes to the way that we procure military equipment. As you know, you and the Defence Committee have had certain discussions on this. Can you give us a date for when that announcement is likely to be made? Can you promise us that it will be made to Parliament first and that we will not read about it on the newswires, not least because the Speaker is at about the limits of his tolerance on this?

"That is good, because the House rises on 26 March and is due back a little after that, but then we are in April and in purdah for the elections and all the rest of it. If it is not by then, you are probably talking about mid-May, realistically. We understand grid management. Can you just give us your commitment---and we respect you, David---that you will do your very best, subject to those extraneous factors, to have it made before we rise for the Easter recess on 26 March?",92,Q34,Mr Francois,"House rising, April purdah, elections, grid management, commitment","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 7.5.

"That is as far as we can ask you to go. That is very good. Thank you very much. Moving on to some programme specifics, let us look at the Royal Navy. There have been many press reports that Type 23 frigates HMS Westminster and HMS Argyll, which have gone into refit, will not come back out, which would take us down to 15 available frigates and destroyers as opposed to the current number of 17 and what was, for very many years, a number of 19.

While the overall tone is positive and grateful, there is also a concern expressed regarding the potential reduction in the number of frigates and destroyers in the Royal Navy."
The Secretary of State has not yet decided on those two particular vessels. We are in negotiation with the Navy so that we can provide the advice to the Secretary of State. He has not yet announced what is going to happen to Westminster and Argyll.,95,Q35,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"Secretary of State's decision, negotiation with Navy, providing advice, fate of Westminster and Argyll, announcement","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. The paragraph does not contain any explicitly positive or negative language, making it neutral. It simply states that a decision has not yet been made and negotiations are ongoing."
"But you cannot tell us for definite that they are coming back. It is subject to final approval, one way or another, by the Secretary of State. It is, metaphorically, on his desk.",96,Q36,Mr Francois,"uncertain return, final approval, Secretary of State, metaphorical desk",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.

"So we are going to have to run the gauntlet of this gap for the best part of another three years, nearly four, when, even on a good day, we may have only 15 escorts available when you knock off the ones that are in refit or deep maintenance. In the Defence Committee's public session, we asked the First Sea Lord, ""How many escorts, including those already on active service, could you put to sea to fight tonight?"" He said eight and a half.

It seems to be leaning slightly towards the positive side, as the person agrees with the point made and expresses a willingness to wait for a decision. However, it is not overly positive or enthusiastic."
"I understand that, but what I am saying is that you have not contradicted me, so we will make that the working assumption for this afternoon. That is eight and a half escorts that the Royal Navy could put to sea. How on earth can we deter Vladimir Putin with eight and a half escorts, when the destroyers' power packs do not work very well and the Type 23 frigates are so old that they keep failing their MOT?

"That is the first point. Secondly, the United Kingdom is not facing down the Russian navy by itself. It is there to deter our adversaries along with an alliance called NATO. Thirdly, we accept that the Type 23s are coming to the end of their life, although some of them will be in service through to the 2030s, which is precisely why you have just given the dates.",107,Q41,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"- First point

"How has this situation been allowed to develop? The Type 26 has slipped again and again. The cost of that one-year extension in time to the taxpayer is nearly £250 million. How old the Type 23s are is not a state secret. It is like that car that you keep putting through for an MOT and, every year, it gets more expensive. Why have we allowed the Type 26 programme to slip to the point where it takes 11 years to build a frigate, when some other nations can build the equivalent in three? How did that happen?",108,Q42,Mr Francois,"cost of Type 26, time extension, Type 23s, British taxpayer, Type 26 programme, building frigate, other nations",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"First, we have to be careful with comparisons. I think that the example you are picking is Japan, which has got down to a three-year build cycle, but we should get down to a three-year build cycle with Type 31 as we come to the back end of the Type 31 build process. Type 26 is an absolutely top-end capability. It is pushing the boundaries of what has been done before in order to provide us with an asset that is as capable as possible to make it. That has had real technical issues in developing the ship.",109,Q42,Andy Start,"- Comparisons

The overall tone seems positive, with the speaker emphasizing the importance of being careful with comparisons and stating that Type 26 is an ""absolutely top-end capability."" However, the mention of ""real technical issues"" suggests some challenges or difficulties in the ship's development, bringing down the overall positivity slightly."
"The good news on Type 26 is that we now appear to have a stable programme. They are making decent progress. I am pleased to see the investment in the build hall. I was up there just before Christmas, and progress on the first ship is starting to really come on. It is disappointing that it takes that long, but the comparisons are not exactly like for like and, as I said, when we get to the back end of the Type 31 programme, we should be at that three-to-four-year build time.",110,Q42,Andy Start,"Type 26 programme, progress, investment, build hall, first ship, build time, Type 31 programme",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as an 8.
"To save time, the Type 26 is a world beater. We have exported it to Australia and Canada. In terms of the prosperity agenda, this is fantastic. The ship is so good that we are anxious to get it into service sooner rather than later. That is why we are beating you up about it a bit: we do not want to wait any longer than we have to for a world beating ship.",111,Q43,Mr Francois,"Type 26, world beater, export to Australia, export to Canada, prosperity agenda, ship, service, beating you up, wait, world beating ship",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 9.
"Let us move on to Fort Victoria. If the carrier sails, it needs a support ship to carry some of its stores. The last one we have that can do that is Fort Victoria, which is nearly 30 years old. We have a competition to build some new ones. That has been delayed and delayed, so they are years away. If the carrier now sails without Fort Victoria, we have to beg, steal and borrow a support ship from another ally. We have spent £10 billion, including the aircraft, on a ""sovereign"" carrier capability that now hangs on borrowing a support ship from another nation. Why did Fort Victoria not sail? Was it because she is not technically ready to put to sea, or you cannot crew her?",112,Q43,Mr Francois,"Fort Victoria, carrier sails, support ship, stores, competition to build new ones, delay, years away, carrier sails without Fort Victoria, beg, steal, borrow, support ship from another ally, £10 billion, aircraft, ""sovereign"" carrier capability, borrowing support ship, Fort Victoria not sailing, technically ready to put to sea, crew.","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 2. The tone is highly critical and negative, with the speaker expressing frustration and disappointment about the current situation regarding the carrier and the lack of a support ship."
"Fort Victoria is going through a scheduled maintenance period. We have the Tide class. They are oilers, but they have the capacity to support a carrier task group in addition to providing it with fuel across the range of logistics support that a carrier task group needs. That is why we are accelerating the FSS programme. You are right that it has had some difficulties, but we are on schedule.",113,Q43,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"- Maintenance period

"Very quickly, yet again, General, we have a situation where we have a critical and very expensive capability---for the record, my father was in the Royal Navy and I am as pro carrier as you are going to find---that hangs on some extremely old warships, because the new warships to replace them are running years late. There is definitely a pattern here, is there not?",116,Q45,Mr Francois,"situation, critical and expensive capability, old warships, new warships running late, pattern",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
I agree.,117,Q45,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,opinion/agreement,"The sentiment expressed in the paragraph is neutral, as it does not provide any specific context or opinion. Therefore, it would receive a rating of 5 on the scale."
So why not do something about it?,118,Q46,Mr Francois,Taking action,8.
"We are. That is why we have commissioned Type 31, Type 26 and FSS. That is why we are commissioning MRSS. We know that many, although not all, of our current maritime platform capabilities are coming to the end of their life. You are articulating the recapitalisation programme of our fleet.

"Forgive me, but we do not accept that. That is why we are here. I have two more quick questions and then I will come back to the Chair. For the LPDs or amphibious assault ships, the out-of-service date for Albion and Bulwark is 2034.",120,Q47,Mr Francois,"- Rejection of something
- Purpose of being present

It is 2032.,121,Q47,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,Time period,"I'm sorry, but the given sentence ""It is 2032."" does not convey any sentiment, as it is a neutral statement indicating a specific year. Therefore, it would not be accurate to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10."

We will argue about that later.",122,Q47,Mr Francois,"PQ, Year discrepancy, Buying a drink, Arguing","The sentiment expressed in the paragraph is difficult to determine as it mainly consists of factual statements and conditional promises rather than expressing a clear positive or negative emotion.

We will take the general's date.,123,Q47,Chair,general's date,7.5
"Is the reason that they now seem to be in play because they are old---they still have nearly the best part of a decade left, whichever one of the two of us you believe---or is it because you cannot crew them?",124,Q48,Mr Francois,"reason for being in play, age, remaining time left, belief, inability to crew",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 4.

My question is why it is even an issue.,126,Q49,Mr Francois,"reasoning, problem identification","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. It is relatively neutral, neither expressing a strong positive nor a strong negative emotion."
"At the very start of this Committee conversation, we accepted that we have workforce issues across the Armed Forces. Therefore, we need to look at the totality of those pressures when we look to start to crew some of these new capabilities that you have talked about.",127,Q49,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"workforce issues, totality of pressures, crewing new capabilities",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
So it is workforce issues and crewing.,128,Q50,Mr Francois,"workforce issues, crewing","It is difficult to accurately rate the sentiment expressed in this paragraph since it is incomplete and lacks emotional context. Without further information, it is not possible to determine whether the sentiment is positive or negative."
"Crewing is definitely an issue within the Royal Navy. We accept that.

"I realise that you are sitting here in lovat green, so it is a difficult question, but thank you. Lastly, on SSNs or attack submarines, we will not talk about the deterrent in open session, but it is widely known and reported on all sorts of websites that, a few months ago, we did not have a single attack submarine at sea, because they were spotted all tied up either in Faslane or in Devonport.

Just give us a rough idea.,132,Q52,Mr Francois,request,"I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7, which leans towards being positive."
"We are quite clear on the numbers. We have one Trafalgar class left, and we have four at sea, with a fifth Astute class soon.",133,Q52,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"numbers, Trafalgar class, at sea, Astute class",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 8.
"With respect, there was no operational readiness. That is the point. They were all tied up.",134,Q53,Mr Francois,"operational readiness, point, being tied up",I would rate the sentiment in the paragraph a 3.
"The operational availability of these platforms and, in fact, the totality of their capability change on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis, depending on what the operational tasking is. I do not think that you would expect me to sit here and give a detailed account of the operational readiness of our SSNs.",135,Q53,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"operational availability, capability change, operational tasking, operational readiness, SSNs","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.

It is a mess, is it not?",136,Q54,Mr Francois,"Father's role on D-Day, Navy's current state, current situation",7
"I would disagree. There is no doubt that we have we have workforce pressures, as the Permanent Secretary has said, including in the Navy, but, as the Secretary of State made clear yesterday and in his speech last week, we are about to launch Steadfast Defender, which sees something like 40% of the total commitment of that exercise across the alliance coming from United Kingdom Armed Forces, including the Royal Navy and a carrier task group.",137,Q54,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"workforce pressures, Steadfast Defender exercise, United Kingdom Armed Forces, Royal Navy, carrier task group",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 6.
"I will meet you halfway. You said, ""We have workforce pressures"", which comes right back to where we started. They are leaving at three times the rate that we can replace them. The workforce pressures are more important than any programmatic that I have just mentioned. If there is no crew, no ship goes to sea.",138,Q54,Mr Francois,"meeting halfway, workforce pressures, retention rate, importance of workforce pressures, programmatic, crew and ship operations",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.5. The speaker acknowledges the challenges and issues discussed but also emphasizes the importance of addressing them in a practical and collaborative manner.
"Inflation has been covered, but we have also been talking about costing uncertainty. I am looking at paragraph 1.27 in the NAO Report, which says, ""The MoD reflects this uncertainty by recording and monitoring two levels of risk"". The first is ""risk inside cost (RIC), which is risk that the MoD judges will probably occur and so includes it in its forecast costs"". It then goes on to say, ""RIC has increased from £13.2 billion in last year's plan (5% of forecast costs) to £22.8 billion this year (8% of forecast costs)"". Mr Wipperman, what proportion of the RIC is inflation?",139,Q55,Mr Djanogly,"Inflation, costing uncertainty, NAO Report, risk inside cost (RIC), forecast costs, Mr Wipperman","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. The paragraph seems to be discussing a specific topic related to costing uncertainty and inflation. The tone appears to be neutral and informational, lacking a strong positive or negative sentiment."
"I would not be able to say explicitly how much of that risk increase is just to do with inflation. The risk inside costing is available to projects within their specific budget to deal with problems or challenges that might emerge as they go through their programme. Some will reflect inflation for those projects that see that as a risk. Some will be other risks. The reason why it has gone up is partly a reflection, as the NAO points out, that we have a growing budget---and you would expect it to grow---but it is also a recognition by us and by projects that we have been in a more volatile economic context. As a result, the level of provision available to projects should go up. That is why you see an increase. As I said, some of it will be for inflation, and some for other risks and issues that we are dealing with.",140,Q55,Tom Wipperman,"risk increase, inflation, risk inside costing, specific budget, problems or challenges, programme, reflection, growing budget, volatile economic context, provision available, increase, inflation, other risks and issues",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
But you cannot break those figures down.,141,Q56,Mr Djanogly,"figures, breakdown",3
"I cannot. I can break down inflation overall and where we are seeing inflation rises. We are seeing inflation in the equipment plan of about £11 billion. On top of that, we have about £2 billion of fuel and forex. While that does not directly translate into the risk, that is additional cost pressure that we are seeing through the plan. Outside the equipment plan, we have about another £5 billion of inflation forecast risk, which is to do with utilities and energy costs, and the cost of maintenance in the estate, as well as about £6 billion to do with the consequences of the consolidated pay awards. In big handfuls, it is equipment and materials, infrastructure, utilities and energy costs, forex and pay.",142,Q56,Andy Start,"inflation overall, inflation rises, equipment plan, fuel and forex, risk cost pressure, utilities and energy costs, cost of maintenance, consolidated pay awards, equipment and materials, infrastructure","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5.5. The paragraph discusses the presence of inflation and cost pressures, which could be seen as negative. However, it also provides some details and breakdowns, which could be seen as informative and potentially more positive. Overall, the sentiment is somewhat neutral."
"That is helpful. That is what I wanted. You said that it has gone up. It has gone up by 63%, which is rather significant. Do you currently expect a similar increase this year, given that inflation is coming down?",143,Q57,Mr Djanogly,"helpfulness, wants, increase, significance, expectation, similar increase, inflation",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 8.
"We are in the process right now of putting together the planning round for this year. We are analysing returns from TLBs to see how costs are playing through to them. In this plan in front of you, on top of that risk provision, we are holding £4 billion of contingency available across the plan as a whole, which is not allocated to any project and is available to us to deploy, should further issues occur.",144,Q57,Tom Wipperman,"1.

What do you mean when you say that you are working it out again at the moment?,145,Q58,Mr Djanogly,"meaning of ""working it out again"", current situation",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5. It is neutral and does not inherently convey a positive or negative emotion.
That is for this year's plan.,146,Q58,Tom Wipperman,year's plan,I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. It is neutral and does not convey a particularly positive or negative sentiment.
At what point do you draw sticks on the inflation figure?,147,Q59,Mr Djanogly,measurement of inflation,I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as around 5.
"Probably towards mid-February, given the way our planning works, we will need to take a snapshot and say that that is the point at which we take a view. We do that for other variables as well, such as forex.",148,Q59,Tom Wipperman,"timeline, planning, snapshot, decision-making, other variables, forex","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. The statement seems neutral and objective, without conveying a particularly positive or negative sentiment."
"General Magowan, what are the capability consequences for our Armed Forces of the plan being unaffordable?",149,Q60,Sarah Owen,"General Magowan, capability consequences, plan affordability, Armed Forces.","It is difficult to rate the sentiment expressed in this paragraph as it does not convey a clear positive or negative sentiment. It appears to be a neutral question seeking information rather than expressing a specific sentiment. Therefore, I would rate it as a 5 on the sentiment scale."
"As I have said to Committees before, it is about balancing the risk against the budget that we are given.",150,Q60,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"risk, budget","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. It is relatively neutral, leaning slightly towards a positive sentiment. The speaker acknowledges the need for balancing risk, which suggests a practical and responsible approach, but there is no strong emotional tone present."
What is that risk?,151,Q61,Sarah Owen,risk,"The sentiment expressed in the paragraph is neutral, as it does not convey any positive or negative emotions. Therefore, it would receive a rating of 5 on the scale."
The financial risk?,152,Q61,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,financial risk,"Without any context provided, it is impossible to determine the sentiment expressed in the given phrase."
"No, your capability risk.",153,Q61,Sarah Owen,capability risk,"Since the given statement is an incomplete sentence, it is difficult to determine the exact sentiment being expressed. Therefore, it is not possible to rate the sentiment on a scale of 1 to 10."
"I have mentioned the operational capability risks publicly before. Those areas where, if I gave you my top four or five, we know that we need to invest more are lessons from not just Ukraine but operations that we are seeing unfolding around the world.",154,Q61,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"operational capability risks, need to invest more, lessons from Ukraine and global operations unfolding",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 6.
"If I were allowed to say only one thing, it would be straight lethality, which the Permanent Secretary has already mentioned. You cannot deter major state-on-state conflict if you cannot prove that you can close with and kill the enemy. To do, that you need lethality, so we need greater munitions stockpiles. Related to that, we need a strong industrial base to be able to produce that, which is a sovereign capability. That would probably be my number one.",155,Q61,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"lethality, major state-on-state conflict, munitions stockpiles, strong industrial base, sovereign capability",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"If I were allowed another two or three in answering your question---but we are balancing these---it is clear that the battlespace of today and tomorrow is such that there are a lot of things flying through the air and trying to do us harm. Therefore, we need the ability to deliver what we call IAMD---or integrated air missile defence. We have a missile defence capability within the UK Armed Forces and within NATO, but we all agree across NATO that it needs to be deeper and broader.",156,Q61,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"question, battlespace, deliverability, IAMD, missile defence, UK Armed Forces, NATO",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 8.
How confident are you that those three priorities that you have set out are going to be included in what Mr Williams puts forward to Ministers and what will actually be delivered?,157,Q62,Sarah Owen,"Confidence in priorities included in Mr Williams' proposal, Delivery of priorities.",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"This is a fundamental question. The point here is that we must demonstrate that the programme of record---and both Mr Wipperman and the Permanent Secretary have made it clear that there are uncommitted elements within the programme of record out to 10 years---is not fixed from now until 2034 as far as our budget is concerned. Therefore, we have to be flexible in identifying those areas that are uncommitted and whether they are a higher or lower priority than the areas that I have just articulated, and there are probably a couple of others.",158,Q62,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"fundamental question, programme of record, uncommitted elements, budget, flexibility, identifying areas, higher or lower priority, other areas","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. The statement is neither particularly positive nor negative, but rather focuses on the need for flexibility and prioritization within a budget."
"As I have said here before, from a military capability perspective, we will have to make hard-edged decisions about deleting, de-scoping or potentially deferring---we will see---to ensure that there is headroom to get after the things that we have just been talking about, and we will do that.",159,Q62,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"military capability, hard-edged decisions, deleting, de-scoping, potentially deferring, headroom, getting after things",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"Given the international developments that you just alluded to in North Korea, Ukraine, China and the Middle East, do the Armed Forces currently have what they need to meet those demands?",160,Q63,Sarah Owen,"international developments (North Korea, Ukraine, China, Middle East), Armed Forces, meeting demands",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. It is neutral and mainly focused on asking a question about the preparedness of the Armed Forces to meet the demands posed by international developments. There is no particular positive or negative sentiment evident in the sentence.
"Yes. This is state-on-state deterrence. We are part of a broad alliance, and my firm judgment and those of my seniors is that we are deterring state-on-state conflict. NATO is not at war. It is deterring state-on-state conflict, and we are part of that. Does that mean that we are not carrying any operational risk? Does that mean that we not do not need to adjust the programme of record to meet those operational risks? No, absolutely not. There are things that we are going to need to invest in. Are we deterring today? Yes, we are. If we need to go to war tonight, we can.",161,Q63,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"- State-on-state deterrence

"Earlier in the Committee, you said that we need to be ready for changes. Are we ready for those changes? Do we have enough resilience built into the system currently to deal with those international developments that we just spoke about?",162,Q64,Sarah Owen,"changes, readiness, resilience, system, international developments","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.5. While the overall tone seems neutral, there is an underlying sense of concern and uncertainty about the preparedness and resilience of the system to handle impending changes."
"Yes, we do, and that is our challenge.",163,Q64,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"existence, challenge","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5. It seems to be neutral, neither overwhelmingly positive nor negative."
"In terms of the plan, as you had alluded to, we said that not all of the cost pressures that are developed into the new capabilities are costed. Mr Williams, why do you not know how much it would cost to deliver all the capabilities set out in the refreshed defence command paper?",164,Q65,Sarah Owen,"plan, cost pressures, new capabilities, costed, Mr Williams, delivering capabilities, refreshed defence command paper","It is difficult to assign a sentiment score to this paragraph as it primarily seeks clarification rather than expressing an opinion or emotion. However, if forced to rate, the sentiment expressed might be around a 5, indicating a neutral stance."
"I think that you are referring to a list at table 5 in the report. Some of the items on that list generally refer to areas where there are choices about what we might do. We have not yet decided, for instance, whether we go for a midlife upgrade of the Meteor long-range air-to-air missile and precisely what that means. The scope of any work is still a decision that we need to make. There are examples where there are decisions still to come.",165,Q65,David Williams,"list at table 5, items on the list, choices about what we might do, midlife upgrade of the Meteor long-range air-to-air missile, scope of any work, decisions still to come.",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.5. The tone is neither very negative nor very positive. It is more neutral and focused on discussing decision-making processes.
"There are examples where we have funded early-stage feasibility and development work, but are still to make a decision on the scale and timing of production. There are programmes where we are working with international partners, so the level of funding that they might bring to a programme is still in negotiation.",166,Q65,David Williams,"funding decision, scale and timing of production, early-stage feasibility and development work, international partners funding negotiation",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"To the general point earlier---I will probably make the same offer as I did to Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown---in our internal view of the programme, we have a good sense of those kinds of decisions that are coming down the track. Over a 10-year period, we expect to have more headroom and choice in the budget in the back end of the programme, so we are thinking about how we can bring those in at the appropriate time, but I accept that it is not necessarily the most transparent part of our planning process in the documentation or the data that we set out.",167,Q65,David Williams,"- Internal view of the programme 
- Decisions coming down the track 
- Headroom and choice in the budget 
- Bringing those in at the appropriate time 
- Transparency of planning process 
- Documentation and data","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.5. The overall tone is somewhat positive, as the speaker mentions having a good sense of upcoming decisions and potential budget flexibility in the future. However, there is also an acknowledgment that this information may not be transparent or well-documented, which slightly detracts from the positivity."
"No, I would say it is as clear as mud. In terms of the 2.5% increase in defence spending, what happens if that gamble of yours does not pay off and you do not receive that before you need it to complete some of these programmes? Coming back to one of the points that you made earlier, you said, ""How do we set a programme without knowing how much money we have?"" Why do you not help the people setting the budget by telling them what your priorities are?",168,Q66,Sarah Owen,"uncertainty of increase in defence spending, potential consequences of not receiving timely funding, setting a programme without knowing available funds, requesting input in setting budget priorities","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 2. The tone is negative and critical, expressing frustration and doubt about the decision-making and prioritization process."
It is not a gamble. It is stated Government policy to increase the defence budget to 2.5% of GDP as economic conditions allow.,169,Q66,David Williams,"Government policy, defence budget, GDP, economic conditions",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.5.
"That is like when I ask my mum, ""When is dinner going to be ready?"" and she says, ""How long is a piece of string?"" If you cannot give us a guaranteed time, or at least a timescale, for this increase in budget, how can you be certain that you are going to be able to deliver the programmes that you need to deliver?",170,Q67,Sarah Owen,"- Dinner preparation time
- Budget increase timeframe
- Delivery of required programmes",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 4.
"To use your analogy, in quite a lot of the conversations that we have with the Treasury, as you might imagine, we are explaining that we are quite hungry now. In the end, it is a matter for the Prime Minister and for the Chancellor, and those are decisions about spending priorities for Government that are properly made in a spending review. Were the Government to change that and to come off 2.5% as their funding ambition, there would need to be conversations about the level of capability that we could buy for the budget that they then agree.",171,Q67,David Williams,"conversations with Treasury, explaining hunger, spending priorities, spending review, funding ambition, level of capability",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as 5.
"How much wriggle room do you have if the spending review were to be delayed, say, for a general election?",172,Q68,Sarah Owen,"spending review, delay, general election",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as around a 3.
"We are working through some short-term pressure, as I said at the beginning. Last week in the House, the Prime Minister suggested that the spending review might be in 2025 rather than in late 2024, but we are talking about six months or so here or there.",173,Q68,David Williams,"short-term pressure, spending review, House, Prime Minister, 2025, late 2024, six months",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 6.5.
"Just to be clear for people who might be tuning in, if there were a general election in the autumn, there could not be a spending review at that point. If whatever Government were elected would like to have a budget shortly after a general election, the next spending review is typically around six months after a budget. Is that the sort of thinking that you are going through in the Ministry of Defence?",174,Q69,Chair,"general election, spending review, budget, Ministry of Defence thinking","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 3. The tone seems neutral and matter-of-fact, without much emotion or positivity present."
There needs to be a local government financial settlement by December of each year.,175,Q69,David Williams,"local government financial settlement, December of each year",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 7.5.
There have been previous examples not that long ago of rolling over an existing spending review by just carrying it on.,176,Q70,Chair,"existing spending review, rolling over, previous examples",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"What I am particularly interested in is when we get to the point of a multi-year settlement, and that may well be at a period of time after a general election.",177,Q70,David Williams,"interest, multi-year settlement, point, period of time, general election","I would rate the sentiment in the paragraph as a 6. There is some level of positivity expressed regarding the possibility of a multi-year settlement, but it is tempered by the uncertainty of it happening after a general election."
So you are expecting to get to a multi-year settlement.,178,Q71,Chair,"expectations, multi-year settlement",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"We had a multi-year settlement at the last spending review and, for defence, that makes sense.",179,Q71,David Williams,"multi-year settlement, spending review, defence, sense","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7. The overall sentiment is positive, as the statement acknowledges the benefit of having a multi-year settlement for defense. However, it is not extremely positive or enthusiastic, hence the rating of 7 rather than a higher score."
"Just to be clear, you are planning on that basis.",180,Q72,Chair,"clarification, planning",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5.

If you could provide a paragraph, I would be happy to help you label the topics.","Without any additional context, it is difficult to determine the sentiment expressed in the given word ""Yes."" As it is a neutral one-word response, it does not convey a clear positive or negative sentiment. Therefore, it can be assigned a neutral rating of 5."
"Our overall priorities are articulated in the defence command paper refresh. We have said that, and we now need to go into a level of detail beneath that, but we have articulated those. From a military capability perspective, we need a long-term settlement. We need a five-year settlement to give us the confidence, particularly with industry, to get after that long-term deterrence that I have been talking about. We cannot live year on year.",182,Q72,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"overall priorities, defence command paper refresh, level of detail, military capability perspective, long-term settlement, five-year settlement, confidence, industry, long-term deterrence, year on year","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.5. The overall tone is positive as it emphasizes the need for articulated priorities, a long-term settlement, and confidence in achieving long-term deterrence. However, there is also a hint of urgency and concern expressed with the statement ""we cannot live year on year."""
"Absolutely, I completely understand that, but what you are asking for is completely unfunded at the moment.",183,Q73,Sarah Owen,"understanding, request, lack of funding",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 3.
"It is not that it is completely unfunded, because we make a set of reasonable assumptions about how the budget might develop beyond the spending review period. Even on a multi-year settlement, there are going to be two or maybe three spending reviews over the period that we are looking at. In the separate information that I sent to the Committee, we set out a central assumption around the overall budget, a downside assumption and an upside assumption. They are simply that---assumptions. We are not looking for a completely blank sheet of paper, but the precise settlement is to be decided.",184,Q73,David Williams,"funding, budget, spending review, assumptions, multi-year settlement, upside assumption, downside assumption, overall budget, settlement",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
But there is a blank space of £12 billion within that.,185,Q74,Sarah Owen,"blank space, £12 billion",5
"It depends very heavily on assumptions about the budget and the content of the programme, what that programme costs and how we need to deliver it.",186,Q74,David Williams,"budget assumptions, programme content, programme cost, delivery method",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.5. It appears to be relatively neutral and does not strongly lean towards either a positive or negative outlook.
"That is a long way of saying that, at the moment, you want to do more than you have money for, which is why we are here today.",187,Q74,Chair,"financial situation, desire for more, current circumstances",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"You said that you wanted a five-year contract so that you could give security to suppliers for the programmes, but should they not be taking the risk, rather than the Government?",188,Q75,Mrs Drummond,"Five-year contract, security for suppliers, risk, Government",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 2.
"Mr Start may want to come in on that, and maybe I will come back.",189,Q75,David Williams,"Mr Start involvement, possibility of returning",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"Companies can reasonably take risk when they have a reasonable chance of an economic return. The challenge that we have at the moment is that there is incredible volatility in the nature of the threat. In the Ukraine conflict at the moment, we are seeing technological changes within a 90-day period. That means that, for the equipment that we think we need, we make our best guess now, but we need to be very adaptable and change it. The risk of that becomes a military rather than a commercial one.",190,Q75,Andy Start,"companies taking risk, economic return, volatility, nature of threat, Ukraine conflict, technological changes, 90-day period, equipment, adaptability, military risk, commercial risk",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"If you are sitting in industry, you can take sensible risk-based decisions around skills. We are seeing that with very substantial investment in skills by the likes of BAE Systems, Babcock and others in terms of building underlying capability, but it is very hard to make firm decisions around production capacity or particular products.",191,Q75,Andy Start,"Industry, risk-based decisions, skills, substantial investment, building underlying capability, production capacity, particular products.",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"That is exacerbated by the fact that, in the defence market, which is not a regular consumer market but one that is heavily influenced by Government policies in different countries, you can sell only when there is aligned Government support for the products that you need in terms of exports. It is not a natural market, and making a strategic investment choice is extremely difficult for industry to do without Government giving it very clear signals.",192,Q75,Andy Start,"defence market, government policies, regular consumer market, aligned government support, products, exports, natural market, strategic investment choice, industry, government signals",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"In the UK, we try to publish as much of the defence pipeline as we can, and we have been increasingly doing a better job of that. We try to do that by engaging industry early in terms of the requirements, and General Rob has been doing groundbreaking work in terms of involving industry at high levels of classification, so it has a better insight than it would have otherwise. In the NATO context, we are trying to do that through the Conference of National Armaments Directors.",193,Q75,Andy Start,"defence pipeline, publishing, UK, industry engagement, requirements, General Rob, industry involvement, high levels of classification, insight, NATO, Conference of National Armaments Directors",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"Without Government giving it appropriate guidelines, the industry cannot make long-term commitments, because the chances of it developing something that does not get sold is high.",194,Q75,Andy Start,"Government guidelines, industry commitments, long-term, development, unsold products",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"Why are we not buying off-the-shelf products from other countries that have already taken this risk, particularly if you need it quickly---as you said, a 90-day one?",195,Q76,Mrs Drummond,"Reasons for not buying off-the-shelf products, Products from other countries, Taking risks, Need for quick delivery, 90-day requirement",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"All countries have the same underlying dynamic problem. Together with our allies, we have to paint as clear a picture as we can of the future need. Wherever possible, we, as Governments, benefit from having interoperable and interchangeable products with other allies. We benefit from when we develop products together, as we are doing with things like GCAP.",196,Q76,Andy Start,"dynamic problem, allies, future need, interoperable and interchangeable products, governments, product development, GCAP",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 8. The overall tone is positive and emphasizes the benefits of cooperation and collaboration among countries and governments.
"Just buying off the shelf leaves you in a situation where you might benefit in the very short term, but, over the longer term, you do not have the level of sovereign ability to adapt and change the military need. In times of conflict, if you do not have national capability, it is very difficult to adapt at speed.",197,Q76,Andy Start,"buying off the shelf, short term benefit, longer term consequences, sovereign ability, adaptability, military need, conflict, national capability, speed",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"Our overall acquisition strategy has to be a blend of having onshore capability, so that we have that sovereign independence, economic growth and jobs, but, also for security reasons, a mixture of international partnerships and some things that we would buy off the shelf because it is much more economic to do.",198,Q76,Andy Start,"acquisition strategy, onshore capability, sovereign independence, economic growth, jobs, security reasons, international partnerships, buying off the shelf","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.5. The passage acknowledges the importance of both onshore capability and international partnerships, which suggests a balanced approach towards acquisition strategy. However, the emphasis on economic factors could be seen as slightly more pragmatic or neutral rather than overtly positive."
We will touch more on the industrial strategy side of this shortly.,199,Q76,Chair,industrial strategy,7
"Mr Start, I cannot help pondering the answer that you gave to the last question. I might refer you to Ajax, where you would have had a vehicle fully in operation by now if you had bought off the shelf, but we are not going to go there.",200,Q77,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"Mr Start, last question answer, pondering, Ajax, vehicle, operation, off the shelf, not going there",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 4.
"Mr Williams, going back to my earlier question, we have been over and over the nuclear enterprise funding gap in the budget of £7.9 billion and the total budget gap of £16.9 billion. How are we going to close that gap?",201,Q77,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"Mr Williams, earlier question, nuclear enterprise funding gap, budget of £7.9 billion, total budget gap of £16.9 billion, closing the gap","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 4.5. The tone seems slightly negative as the mentioned funding gaps and the need to close them imply financial challenges. However, it is not extremely negative as it is not directly criticizing the situation."
"Yes, so £7.9 billion of the £16.9 billion is currently showing against the nuclear enterprise. Our initial experience within the nuclear ringfence that we have been operating this year is that our first set of cost estimations have been about right. We will deliver within that budget without deliberately having had to slow programmes down.",202,Q77,David Williams,"budget, cost estimations, nuclear enterprise, programmes",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as an 8.
"Part of the way in which we manage that cost pressure will be through the exceptional flexibilities that we have agreed with the Treasury for the nuclear ring-fence, which will allow us both to commit spend at pace through more streamlined approvals processes and to bring money forward and backward to address risk as it begins to crystallise.",203,Q77,David Williams,"- Managing cost pressure
- Exceptional flexibilities
- Agreements with Treasury 
- Nuclear ring-fence 
- Streamlined approvals processes 
- Committing spend at pace 
- Bringing money forward and backward 
- Addressing risk",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"It reflects about 7% of the nuclear budget over the 10-year period. At this stage, my expectation is that that level of financial pressure will be broadly manageable.",204,Q77,David Williams,"nuclear budget, financial pressure",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"I am absolutely certain that the flexibility you have gained from the Treasury is very useful, but how likely is it that in next funding reviews you are going to need to come back and ask for more money for the nuclear enterprise?",205,Q78,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"flexibility from Treasury, usefulness of flexibility, likelihood of needing more money for nuclear enterprise, future funding reviews",6
"I cannot rule it out, but part of the reason for the particular increase in this planning round is that we deliberately asked our colleagues working in the nuclear enterprise to make sure that they were being comprehensive and risk-aware in the numbers that they put in.",206,Q78,David Williams,"reason for increase in planning round, requesting colleagues to be comprehensive and risk-aware in the numbers they put in",I would rate the sentiment expressed in this paragraph as a 7.
"There are always adjustments up and down, but, in comparison to previous planning rounds, this is a much less financially risky position and a more comprehensive view not only within the Defence Nuclear Organisation but in allied top-level budget areas. Nuclear costs within the Royal Navy and Strategic Command have been included within that ring-fence.",207,Q78,David Williams,"adjustments, financially risky position, comprehensive view, Defence Nuclear Organisation, allied top-level budget areas, Nuclear costs, Royal Navy, Strategic Command, ring-fence","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.5. It is relatively positive, highlighting a less financially risky position and a more comprehensive view within the Defence Nuclear Organisation and allied budget areas. The inclusion of nuclear costs within the Royal Navy and Strategic Command is also mentioned in a positive light. However, there is some ambiguity in the language used, which reduces the overall positivity of the sentiment."
"There has been quite a lot of de-risking in this planning round. It is often in the nature of nuclear costs that they can move around, but this is a much healthier position than we have been in for a number of years, in my view.",208,Q78,David Williams,"de-risking, planning round, nature of nuclear costs, healthier position",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as an 8.
"""We are in a much healthier position than we have been in for a number of years"". That is a really interesting statement.",209,Q79,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"healthier position, interesting statement",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 7.
"Mr Wipperman, given that the nuclear enterprise budget is consuming such a large proportion of the total budget, how likely is it that, in order to fund it, you are going to have to further cut conventional weapons over the next 10 years?",210,Q79,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"- Mr. Wipperman's perspective on the nuclear enterprise budget
- Proportion of the total budget allocated to the nuclear enterprise budget
- Likelihood of further cuts in conventional weapons funding over the next 10 years",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5.
"The answer to that partly goes back to what the Permanent Secretary has been saying about potential future funding scenarios. The letter that the Permanent Secretary sent to the Committee set out some of those scenarios. In one of those scenarios, the funding for nuclear that we receive from the Treasury continues. That leaves you with this £7.9 billion, which, as we have set out, we think is manageable over a £100 billion 10-year budget.",211,Q79,Tom Wipperman,"- Answering the question about funding scenarios
- Statement from the Permanent Secretary
- Scenarios outlined in the letter
- Continuation of funding for nuclear
- Remaining budget of £7.9 billion
- Manageability of the budget over a 10-year period","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6. On one hand, there is some optimism implied in the statement that the funding for nuclear continues and that the amount is considered manageable. However, there is also a sense of uncertainty and potential challenges highlighted by the mention of different funding scenarios. Overall, the sentiment leans towards a neutral or slightly positive outlook."
"That is predicated on, as Ms Owen says, the Treasury granting you this extra 2.5% of GDP. If you do not get that, does that answer still stand?",212,Q80,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"- Predicated on 
- Treasury granting
- Extra 2.5% of GDP
- Not getting that
- Does the answer still stand",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. The statement appears to be neutral and does not strongly convey a positive or negative sentiment.
"I was going to go on to say that in the lower-bound scenarios that we set out, where we have a lower budget than we might currently forecast, we would have to work with Ministers about the sorts of choices available to them and where they would want to balance capabilities.",213,Q80,Tom Wipperman,"lower-bound scenarios, lower budget, forecast, work with Ministers, choices available, balance capabilities",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"Just to be clear, in the central budget scenario, which generates the £7.9 billion, we have made no assumption about progress to the 2.5% as a policy choice. That is in our upside budget scenario.",214,Q80,David Williams,"central budget scenario, £7.9 billion, assumption about progress to the 2.5% as a policy choice, upside budget scenario",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
Yes.,215,Q80,Tom Wipperman,"Unfortunately, there is not enough context provided in the paragraph to determine the specific topics being discussed.","There is no clear sentiment expressed in the sentence ""Yes."" Therefore, it is not possible to rate its sentiment on a scale from 1 to 10."
It does assume that £7.9 billion.,216,Q81,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,assumption of £7.9 billion,"I'm sorry, but the given statement is incomplete and does not express a sentiment. Can you please provide more context or complete the sentence so I can accurately rate the sentiment?"
Yes.,217,Q81,David Williams,There is not enough information provided in the paragraph to label the topics being discussed.,"I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. The statement ""Yes"" does not inherently carry a positive or negative sentiment. It is a neutral response that could be interpreted differently depending on the context."
"Yes, it does.",218,Q81,Tom Wipperman,response,"It is difficult to rate the sentiment expressed in the given sentence, as it is a simple statement without any clear emotional connotation. Therefore, I would rate it as a neutral sentiment, or 5 on the scale."
"Otherwise you will be left with a scenario where you will have to cut conventional spending, if you do not get that 2.5% of GDP expenditure.",219,Q82,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"consequences of not obtaining 2.5% of GDP expenditure, necessary spending cuts",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. The statement is relatively neutral and does not strongly lean towards either a positive or negative sentiment.
"Yes, if the nuclear enterprise is unable to manage the costs within the funding envelope that we expect to give it, and if at that point we choose to find savings in the non-nuclear side of the programme rather than deliver nuclear within the ring-fence. There are some variables there.",220,Q82,David Williams,"nuclear enterprise costs, funding envelope, non-nuclear side savings, delivering nuclear within the ring-fence, variables",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"That is understood. Mr Wipperman, very briefly because time is moving on, what capacity did the delivery agency and industry have to deliver the nuclear programme more quickly and therefore help save costs?",221,Q83,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"Understanding, Mr. Wipperman's capacity in the delivery agency and industry, Delivery of nuclear program more quickly, Saving costs.","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7. While the tone appears neutral, there might be a slight hint of urgency and concern about time constraints, which slightly tilts the sentiment towards the negative end."
"Mr Start might be better placed on some of the industry, but, in terms of how we put together the plan, the forecast is based on the defence nuclear enterprise, the Defence Nuclear Organisation and the associated elements giving their judgment working with industry about its ability to deliver.",222,Q83,Tom Wipperman,"Mr Start, industry, plan, forecast, defence nuclear enterprise, Defence Nuclear Organisation, associated elements, judgment, working with industry, ability to deliver",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"At the spring Budget this time, in March 2023, we received an extra £3 billion spend for nuclear, £1 billion for this year and £2 billion for next. We currently forecast that we are on track to spend that extra funding and to get that out through the supply chain. We did a lot of work with the DNO to get an assessment of realistic spend profiles. Currently, we think we will be able to deliver, but Mr Start may be better placed to talk about it more broadly.",223,Q83,Tom Wipperman,"Spring Budget, extra funding for nuclear, forecast, spending, supply chain, work with DNO, assessment of spend profiles, delivery, Mr Start",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"If I can come in first, last year Ministers announced a nuclear skills taskforce looking at both defence and civil nuclear skills requirements in the round. Our assumptions going into that work, based on some earlier internal reviews, have been that across the defence nuclear enterprise over the course of around a 10-year period we will probably need an extra 10,000 or so apprentices, graduate engineers and so on to deliver on the totality of the defence nuclear ambition.",224,Q83,David Williams,"- Nuclear skills taskforce
- Defence and civil nuclear skills requirements
- Assumptions and earlier internal reviews
- Extra 10,000 apprentices, graduate engineers, and others needed for defence nuclear ambition.","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6. It is generally positive due to the mention of a nuclear skills taskforce and the need for additional apprentices and engineers. However, it is not overly positive, as it also implies a potential challenge of fulfilling the ""defence nuclear ambition"" requiring a significant increase in personnel over a 10-year period."
That skills taskforce made good progress over the back end of last year. A report will shortly be with Ministers for them to consider. The announcement on that will get to the heart of your question.,225,Q83,David Williams,"skills taskforce progress, report for Ministers, announcement","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.5. The statement overall seems neutral, with neither strong positive nor negative sentiments."
"This question is either to you, Mr Williams, or to Mr Start. We have talked about speeding up the defence nuclear enterprise to save money. Does the same argument still apply to the conventional weapons budget---that, if you could speed up some of the programmes, you would be able to save money and make the programme more affordable?",226,Q84,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"- addressee of the question: Mr. Williams, Mr. Start

"Yes. Both in hearings here and in the Defence Sub-Committee that Mr Francois chaired, there was a renewed and welcome emphasis on pace. That will be a key feature of the announcements by Ministers around our new procurement model. In a world of high inflation, delivering more quickly, or at least delivering on time, avoids inflationary cost pressures.",227,Q84,David Williams,"hearings on pace, Defence Sub-Committee, new procurement model, announcements by Ministers, high inflation, delivering quickly, delivering on time, inflationary cost pressures.",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
In the kind of uncertain world that we are in---we have talked in the defence command paper about sprinting to a 70% or 80% capability and then spiralling---getting usable capability into the hands of the warfighter more quickly is the capability ambition. That is the most important piece. It has the advantage of probably allowing you to deliver it more cheaply.,228,Q84,David Williams,"uncertain world, defence command paper, sprinting to a 70% or 80% capability, spiralling, getting usable capability into the hands of the warfighter, capability ambition, delivering it more cheaply",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
Can you give us an exemplar---it will probably be one of those green projects in the GMPP---of a project that is well ahead of schedule at the moment and that you are proud of?,229,Q85,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"exemplar, green projects, GMPP, project schedule, pride",I would rate the sentiment expressed in this paragraph as a 7.
"We only have one green project in the GMPP. No, we have two. I do not know whether General Rob wants to comment.",230,Q85,David Williams,"green project, GMPP, General Rob's comment","I would rate the sentiment in the paragraph a 5. It is fairly neutral as there is a mix of positive and negative elements - mentioning two green projects is positive, but the uncertainty about General Rob's comment adds some negative tone."
"Can I take it from the other angle? We accept the challenge that, with all the programmes here, in quarter 3, 11 of them are at red. Half of those are in the areas that you have just been talking about, so complex weapons or the nuclear enterprise.",231,Q85,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"1) Taking an alternative perspective

"To support what the Permanent Secretary said, there are a range of reasons for that.",232,Q85,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"support, Permanent Secretary, reasons","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6. While it is not overly positive, it is also not particularly negative. The statement seems neutral and objective, indicating that there are various reasons to support the Permanent Secretary's statement."
I was not really going into those. I just wanted one exemplar of which you are proud that it is being delivered on time or even ahead of budget.,233,Q86,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"project delivery, meeting deadlines",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5. It is neither strongly negative nor positive.
A number of the Air Force programmes are developing well. We have had F-35B success.,234,Q86,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"Air Force programmes, F-35B success",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as an 8.
That was a conventionally established programme.,235,Q87,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,conventionally established programme,I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"Yes, but you are asking for a major programme, a cat A programme, that is delivering to cost and time. We are rolling that out. We now have the second squadron up and running. We will have 48 F-35Bs certainly delivered from 2025. We are looking to grow that to 74. There is an example of a programme that is delivering operational capability today.",236,Q87,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"major programme, cat A programme, delivering to cost and time, rolling out, second squadron, F-35Bs, delivered from 2025, grow to 74, operational capability","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as an 8. The speaker is expressing a positive outlook on the progress of the programme and the delivery of the F-35Bs, indicating that they are meeting their cost and time targets and are looking to expand their capabilities."
"Sir Geoffrey, if you look at some of the things we have done for Ukraine, we have tried to take these opportunities around acceleration that we are trying to build into the longer-term system. We have then been able to be very successful in delivering a lot of capability very quickly.",237,Q87,Andy Start,"Ukraine support, acceleration, longer-term system, capability delivery",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 8.
"An example is the acquisition of Archer, where we replenished using an existing off-the-shelf capability at real speed. A second example is the way that we have introduced the use of both armed and unarmed drones, taking technology from concept through to operation in weeks and months rather than years and decades. There are some really exciting opportunities that we have demonstrated in that space.",238,Q87,Andy Start,"Archer acquisition, off-the-shelf capability, armed and unarmed drones, technology development, operational implementation, exciting opportunities",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 9.
"We are trying to roll out that kind of approach, where we take more operational risk, get our capabilities out more quickly and then spiral up. We are doing that in the conventional weapons space, in particular in munitions.

It is Wildcat.,240,Q87,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,Wildcat,"Without any other context provided, it is difficult to accurately rate the sentiment expressed in the given statement. As it simply states ""It is Wildcat,"" it does not convey any positive or negative sentiment. Therefore, the sentiment can be rated as neutral, possibly a 5 on the scale."
"In both cases, we got a capability out quickly and then we spiralled that capability up by increasing its capability over time. That is the approach that we need to use much more widely.",241,Q87,Andy Start,"capability out quickly, spiralling capability up, approach",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 8.
"We are also trying to take approaches that are more modular. Within the Boxer programme, similar to the concept of the Type 31 programme, we get out the basic capability that is the underlying platform, and then we can enhance that platform with mission modules and enhanced capabilities over time. That gives us a solid basis but allows us to be flexible and spiral in capabilities more quickly.",242,Q87,Andy Start,"modular approaches, Boxer programme, Type 31 programme, basic capability, underlying platform, mission modules, enhanced capabilities, solid basis, flexibility, spiral in capabilities","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 9. It is very positive as the speaker emphasizes the use of modular approaches and enhancing capabilities over time, which is seen as beneficial and flexible."
"We are used to asking critical questions in this Committee, but congratulations. The UK is recognised around the world as having got those capabilities out very quickly.",243,Q87,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"critical questions, congratulations, UK capabilities, quick response",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"Can I just go back to F-35, General Magowan? We have been following this for some time. We had the aircraft carriers without the aircraft, but we still have issues about the number that we need to have full capability. We are still quite far short of what we need to do. It is a programme that is beginning to deliver, but it is still behind where it ideally ought to be, given that we need those to make the carrier group operate fully and effectively. We also need the crew. That is another area that we have looked at, along with the training for pilots.",244,Q88,Chair,"F-35, aircraft carriers, number of aircraft, full capability, programme delivery, carrier group operation, crew, training for pilots",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 4.5.

"The programme of record at the moment is designed to deliver three squadrons. We are rewriting the routine operating model at the moment. It is going to the Secretary of State in the next few weeks and months. There will be a ramp-up from what we originally said back in 2017. Either way, the headmark is for three operational squadrons by the early 2030s, but in the short to medium term there will be two squadrons operationally deployed with a training unit, an OCU, by 2025.",251,Q91,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"programme of record, delivering three squadrons, rewriting routine operating model, going to Secretary of State, ramp-up, headmark of three operational squadrons by early 2030s, short to medium term, two squadrons operationally deployed, training unit, OCU, by 2025","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.5. The overall tone seems neutral to slightly positive. There is mention of rewriting the operating model, which implies progress and improvement. The statement about a ramp-up from previous plans suggests a positive outlook for the future. However, the paragraph does not explicitly convey extremely positive or enthusiastic sentiment."
We are on schedule for that.,252,Q91,Chair,schedule,8
"Yes, we are.",253,Q91,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,confirmation,"Without any additional context, it is difficult to accurately rate the sentiment expressed in the given statement."
"Mr Start, for the record, when the Defence Sub-Committee looked at DNS, as you know, we were critical in a number of areas, but, on the principle of credit where it is due, we gave your organisation a lot of credit for everything you have done for the Ukrainians. Today, by the same token, for the record, it is worth recording in public session that, because your teams worked unbelievably hard, although we cannot quantify the number of Ukrainian lives you have saved, it will probably be in the thousands. Perhaps you will be kind enough to carry back the compliments of this Committee to all of your people at DE&S who pulled out all the stops to do that.",254,Q92,Mr Francois,"- Defence Sub-Committee's criticism of DNS
- Credit given to Mr. Start's organization for their work with Ukrainians
- Unquantifiable number of Ukrainian lives saved
- Compliments to DE&S and their hardworking teams.",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 9. It is very positive and complimentary towards Mr Start and his organization for their efforts in helping the Ukrainians and saving lives.
"Thank you, Mr Francois. It is much appreciated.",255,Q92,Andy Start,"expression of gratitude, acknowledgment",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 9.
"That was the good bit. Mr Williams, can I just check something that you said earlier just to make sure we understood what you said?",256,Q93,Mr Francois,"the good bit, checking clarification",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"You have a problem. This is a 10-year plan, but you only know how much public spending that you have going forward three years. That is always a challenge. Am I right that you said from 2027, so the back end of this plan, the second half really, you were using more optimistic financial assumptions---i.e. that by then we will be spending about 2.5% of GDP on defence? Did I understand you correctly?",257,Q93,Mr Francois,"problem, 10-year plan, public spending, challenge, optimistic financial assumptions, 2.5% of GDP, defence","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as neutral, so a 5 out of 10. The passage discusses a challenge of not having enough information about future public spending, but does not explicitly express a negative or positive opinion about it. However, the mention of using more optimistic financial assumptions towards the end could be seen as slightly positive."
All of the analysis is based on data that we have shared with the NAO. That 16.9% budgetary pressure is based on a central assumption. I have made no assumptions in that about a trajectory to 2.5% of GDP at all.,258,Q93,David Williams,"data sharing with NAO, budgetary pressure, central assumption, trajectory to 2.5% of GDP","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. The tone seems neutral, neither overly positive nor negative."
You have not.,259,Q93,Mr Francois,- Lack of something,"Unfortunately, it is not possible to accurately rate the sentiment expressed in the given paragraph, as it only consists of two words (""You have not"") and does not provide enough context or information to determine a sentiment."
"We have an upside budget scenario. This is not based on any agreement with the Treasury. It is a set of assumptions that looks at what a growth of 2.5% of GDP by the end of the 10-year planning period, starting at the end of the next spending review period---let us say 2027-28---would look like.",260,Q93,David Williams,"upside budget scenario, agreement with the Treasury, assumptions, growth of 2.5% of GDP, 10-year planning period, next spending review period","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.5. The statement is relatively neutral and objective, discussing a potential budget scenario without explicitly expressing a positive or negative sentiment."
"If you get the ""optimistic"" outcome from your point of view, and mine too by the way, does that deficit disappear?",261,Q94,Mr Francois,"outcomes, perspectives, deficit",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"Yes, except that there is obviously a mismatch of profile because that gives you more money in the last five years of the plan.",262,Q94,David Williams,"Mismatch of profile, more money, last five years of the plan.",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 4.
"It all fits, though.",263,Q95,Mr Francois,unclear,7
It fits across the 10-year period.,264,Q95,David Williams,duration,"I would rate the sentiment in the given paragraph as a 5. It is neither particularly negative nor positive, but rather neutral."
"I have one more, very quickly, and then I will go into some specifics. With the £17 billion deficit, what proportion of GDP are we spending on defence in that scenario? In your central assumption, what is your percentage assumption?",265,Q96,Mr Francois,"deficit, GDP spending on defence, specific details on assumptions","Based on the provided paragraph, the sentiment expressed seems neutral and not easily determinable. Therefore, I would rate it as a 5 on the scale."
This is to fill the gap.,266,Q96,Chair,filling the gap,5
"Is it 2.2%, 2.25% or 2.3%?",267,Q96,Mr Francois,interest rates,"I would rate the sentiment expressed in this paragraph as a 4. Although the tone of the sentence is mostly neutral, there might be a slight frustration or confusion in the question as the person is uncertain and seeking clarification."
"On the current assumptions that are built in this, based on the latest OBR forecast from November, by the end of the decade it will be about 2.1% of GDP.",268,Q96,Tom Wipperman,"current assumptions, latest OBR forecast, end of the decade, 2.1% of GDP","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6. While the statement seems factual and neutral, it does not necessarily convey a strong positive or negative sentiment."
"This plan with the £17 billion ""black hole"", to use media language, is based on us spending 2.1% of GDP on defence, plus Ukraine.",269,Q97,Mr Francois,"budget deficit, defense spending, GDP, Ukraine",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 3.
"No, it makes no assumption about the future of Ukraine. This financial year, we are forecasting 2.25% including Ukraine. Next year, we are forecasting 2.26% including Ukraine. We have no agreed funding for Ukraine.",270,Q97,Tom Wipperman,"future of Ukraine, financial forecast, funding for Ukraine",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. It is a neutral statement that presents the financial forecasts for Ukraine but does not convey any positive or negative emotion.
"All right, I have got that. When the agreed funding runs out, it is based on 2.1%.",271,Q98,Mr Francois,"agreed funding, 2.1%",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"No, it will reach 2.1% in year 10 of this plan. It will be a downward trajectory year on year on that current forecast, but you would get to 2.1%, starting at 2.26%. It will be 2.26% in year 2 and 2.1% in year 10.",272,Q98,Tom Wipperman,"projection, trajectory, forecast",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5. It is neither very negative nor very positive.
"If it were to be 2.5% in an ideal world, that black hole disappears. I have got it. That is very clear.",273,Q99,Mr Francois,"ideal world, black hole, understanding",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as an 8.
"Just taking this year, the difference between 2.25% and 2.5% of GDP is about £6 billion or £7 billion.",274,Q99,David Williams,"percentage difference, GDP, £6 billion, £7 billion",6
"We get the point that many of the costs are frontloaded. We have got that. That is very helpful. Let us come on to the RAG ratings, the colours, very quickly.",275,Q100,Mr Francois,"- Understanding the frontloaded costs
- Importance of the frontloaded costs
- RAG ratings and colours",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"For the benefit of our thousands of viewers abroad, the National Audit Office, which prepared this Report, is Parliament's auditor, not the Government's. The Government, since 2012, have had their own auditor called the Infrastructure Projects Authority, or IPA for short, nothing to do with a particular brand of beer. It goes through all the major Government infrastructure programmes, including in defence, and the biggest is Dreadnought. Then it assigns a RAG rating, red, amber or green, to each programme.",276,Q100,Mr Francois,"National Audit Office, Parliament's auditor, Government's auditor, Infrastructure Projects Authority, IPA, brand of beer, major Government infrastructure programmes, defence, Dreadnought, RAG rating",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.5.
"We have got into muddles in the past about which colours to use because sometimes you use slightly different colours. We are using the IPA colours, for the avoidance of doubt. It is page 37, paragraph 211. Of the 52 that it looked at, six were classified and so have not been rated, so 46 of the 52 had a rating. Five were red; 35 were amber; and two, only two, were green. Green is defined as, ""Successful delivery on time, budget and quality appears highly likely"". By my maths, of the 52, that is barely 4%. That is awful, is it not, Mr Williams?",277,Q100,Mr Francois,"colours to use, IPA colours, page 37, paragraph 211, classification of 52 items, ratings, red items, amber items, green items, definition of green, percentage of successful delivery, Mr Williams.",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 3.
"As we have discussed previously, we are absolutely not complacent about the number that are amber. There are a range of technical, commercial and delivery challenges in getting our most major and complex programmes delivered.",278,Q100,David Williams,"previous discussion, not complacent about amber numbers, technical challenges, commercial challenges, delivery challenges, major and complex programmes","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7. The tone of the statement is generally neutral, leaning slightly towards the negative side. While the language acknowledges challenges and shows a lack of complacency, it does not convey extreme positivity or excitement."
"The proportion of red, amber and green is not materially out of kilter with the IPA's reviews of more conventional programmes in terms of infrastructure and construction, Government transformation and IT delivery.",279,Q100,David Williams,"proportion of red, amber and green, IPA's reviews, infrastructure and construction, Government transformation, IT delivery",5

deterrence of Vladimir Putin 
HS2 
extra leg",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5.
"Let us come back to this point. The definition of amber---most of them are amber---is, ""Delivery appears feasible but significant issues already exist, requiring management attention"". That is still something to worry about. Red, for the record, means, ""Successful delivery appears to be unachievable"".",281,Q101,Mr Francois,"- Definition of amber
- Feasibility of delivery
- Significant issues
- Management attention
- Concerns
- Definition of red
- Unachievable successful delivery",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"The red projects include the future combat air system, GCAP, Tempest, which is embarrassing, the core production capability for nuclear submarine reactors, which is embarrassing, MODNet Evolve---okay, that is still embarrassing---the Brimstone 3 air-to-surface weapon and the SPEAR cap 3 air-to-air weapon.",282,Q101,Mr Francois,"red projects, future combat air system, GCAP, Tempest, core production capability for nuclear submarine reactors, MODNet Evolve, Brimstone 3 air-to-surface weapon, SPEAR cap 3 air-to-air weapon, embarrassing.",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 3.
"We have just signed a treaty with the Japanese and the Italians for the future combat air system, and yet the Government's own auditor says the programme is red.",283,Q101,Mr Francois,"treaty with Japanese and Italians, future combat air system, Government's auditor, programme being red",4
"We should just be clear. The IPA is not quite an auditor. I know you are using shorthand, Mr Francois.",284,Q101,Chair,"clarification, role of IPA, shorthand, addressing Mr Francois",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
They are the programme delivery experts in Government.,285,Q101,David Williams,"programme delivery experts, Government","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.5 on the scale. It conveys a positive sentiment about the abilities and expertise of the individuals being referred to as ""programme delivery experts."" However, it does not reach the highest level of positivity."
"Red means, ""Successful delivery appears to be unachievable"". We just signed an international treaty with two other nations. That is a bit embarrassing, is it not?",286,Q101,Mr Francois,"Failure of successful delivery, International treaty, Embarrassment",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5.
"Colleagues may want to come in on the detail, particularly General Rob on GCAP. This is about the degree of difficulty in delivering against the planned 2035 in-service date.",287,Q101,David Williams,"Colleagues' interest in detail, General Rob's perspective on GCAP, Degree of difficulty in delivering against the planned 2035 in-service date.",8
"There are examples---you will ask me now to give you one, and I will probably have to write to you---of programmes that are rated red, which, as a result of intervention, re-scoping or throwing additional resource at them, you can recover from red to amber.",288,Q101,David Williams,"examples of programmes rated red, intervention, re-scoping, additional resource, recovering from red to amber","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.5. The statement is generally positive, as it discusses the possibility of recovering red-rated programs to an amber rating through intervention and additional resources. However, the use of phrases like ""you will ask me now to give you one"" and ""I will probably have to write to you"" may slightly dampen the overall positive tone."
"David, I am sorry. I will save you a letter. F-35 was red last year, from memory.",289,Q102,Mr Francois,"apology, saving a letter, F-35, color change",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"Thank you, yes.",290,Q102,David Williams,"expressing gratitude, agreement",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"It is now amber. That is right, is it not? There is still a long way to go, as Dame Meg was saying, but F-35 is slowly going in the right direction and not the wrong direction, is it not, General?",291,Q102,Mr Francois,"color change (amber), affirmation, progress, F-35 direction, affirmation (F-35 going in the right direction), negation (F-35 not going in the wrong direction), addressing General",5
"Yes, absolutely.",292,Q102,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"agreement, affirmation",8
That is just to prove we were listening to you.,293,Q102,Mr Francois,proof of listening,"I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 7.5. It reflects a positive sentiment as it acknowledges that the speaker was paying attention and demonstrates their attentiveness. However, it could potentially be higher if the statement was more enthusiastic or appreciative."
"Yes, it does not look good. It is very difficult to talk generically, though. There are 52 programmes in there and there are a range of reasons. We do have to get into the specifics of the programmes, which we can do. I have it all here.",294,Q102,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"programmes, difficulty of generic conversation, reasons for 52 programmes, need for specificity, availability of information",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"There are some general trends, and the Permanent Secretary has already alluded to one of them, which is SQEP---you used the expression---suitably qualified and experienced personnel. That is true particularly across the nuclear space---there are a number of nuclear reds---and the technical spaces associated with defence, digital and complex weapons.",295,Q102,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"general trends, SQEP (suitably qualified and experienced personnel), nuclear space, nuclear reds, technical spaces, defence, digital, complex weapons",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 6.
"Some of these are difficult international negotiations, which involve political conversations. That can lead to deliberation. Those would be my top three.",296,Q102,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"difficult international negotiations, political conversations, deliberations, top three",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"General Rob, you have said that it is difficult to generalise, but these have all been examined in great detail by the IPA. It has not generalised; it has scrutinised all of them individually and then given them a RAG rating. In that sense, they are not generalisations.",297,Q103,Mr Francois,"difficult to generalise, examined in great detail by the IPA, RAG rating, not generalisations",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"Even if you take out the classified programmes, there are only two green out of 46, one of which, ironically, is the fleet solid support ship. By my maths, that is still less than 5%. In pub English, barely one in 20 of these procurement programmes is running to time and cost. That is appalling, is it not?",298,Q103,Mr Francois,"classified programmes, green, fleet solid support ship, percentage, procurement programmes, running to time and cost, appalling",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 3.
"They are the 50 most complex things that we are trying to do, so it does not surprise me that at various points in project lives they are not really---",299,Q103,David Williams,"complex things, project lives, various points",4
"Mr Williams, the taxpayer employs you people on a lot more than we are getting in order to make these complex things go right, do they not?",300,Q104,Mr Francois,"employment, taxpayer, complex things",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
That complexity is the reason why we think P50 is an unsafe assumption.,301,Q104,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"complexity, P50 assumption, safety",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5.
Just explain P50. We understand it.,302,Q104,Chair,label: P50 explanation,I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 7.
"As the Permanent Secretary says, these are the most complex projects. The nuclear ones are probably at the top of the list. We plan on the probability of us hitting our milestones being 50%, on a normal bell curve. Because of the complexity of the nuclear enterprise, and we are trying to get to a point where we are trying to be more realistic, we have now determined that it is better to be at P70.",303,Q104,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"Permanent Secretary, complex projects, nuclear ones, top of the list, milestones, probability, bell curve, complexity of nuclear enterprise, being more realistic, P70",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5.
That is good. We wanted P75.,304,Q105,Mr Francois,"Opinion, desired quantity",7
It is P70 for the nuclear enterprise.,305,Q105,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,cost of nuclear enterprise,I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"The problem with P50, again in pub English, is that you have half as much chance of being wrong as you have of being right. If I went to buy a car, I would not say to the car dealer, ""Is there a P50 chance that it might start when I turn the key?"" I would not buy the car.",306,Q105,Mr Francois,"P50 problem, pub English, chance of being wrong, chance of being right, buying a car",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 2.
"Mr Francois, you have quoted what amber is. Just to be clear, I will give the full definition so that we can get an answer from the witnesses about what they are doing in this respect. The definition of an amber project is, ""Successful delivery appears feasible but significant issues already exist, requiring management attention"" and then, crucially, ""These appear resolvable at this stage and, if addressed promptly, should not present a cost/schedule overrun"". It might be helpful if you could pluck a couple of amber examples and tell us what you are doing to address them promptly so they do not cause a cost or schedule overrun.",307,Q106,Chair,"- Quoting what amber is
- Full definition of an amber project
- Asking witnesses about what they are doing in this respect
- Importance of addressing issues promptly
- Requesting examples of amber projects and actions taken",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
That is footnote 12 on page 37.,308,Q106,Mr Francois,"footnote 12, page 37",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. The statement is neutral and does not contain any explicit positive or negative sentiment.
"Yes, indeed. Mr Start, perhaps you would respond.",309,Q106,Chair,"acknowledgment, addressing someone as Mr Start, requesting a response",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"I would be delighted to do so. If I may, I will speak to red briefly. What is helpful about this system is that it allows us as delivery agents to focus on where really senior management attention is needed.",310,Q106,Andy Start,"Delighted to do so, speaking to red briefly, system helpfulness, delivery agent focus, senior management attention",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as 9.
"In the case of the couple of reds that are within my portfolio, one of them is red because the supplier has some really difficult technical issues that it is wrestling with. That is making it late. It will get there, but that is making it late. I could take that particular capability to war, if I had to, but I would be doing so with increased risk. I do not want to do that unless I have to. That is red in terms of meeting the obligations that we have set on it, but I can fight with it if I need to.",311,Q106,Andy Start,"portfolio, reds, difficult technical issues, supplier, late, capability, war, risk, obligations",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"The other one is red because I am waiting for a capability from an ally that I need to integrate that platform on to. I do not have a date from them yet because they are working on some other things. As a consequence, it is red because we just do not know a critical dependency. That makes it red. When we have resolved that, it will come off red. It is flagged as red because it is not within our control.",312,Q106,Andy Start,"platform integration, capability, dependency, date, ally, red flag, control","I would rate the sentiment expressed in this paragraph as a 5. While it is not overtly positive or negative, it does express some frustration and uncertainty due to the dependency on an ally and the lack of control over the situation."
"If I could take some amber ones, in general, we set pretty aggressive targets on our teams to deliver capability because our military wants capability as quickly as possible and within a timeframe. The targets that we set on the teams themselves are quite aggressive, and therefore I would expect most project managers to say they are struggling to hold the aggressive times that we give them.",313,Q106,Andy Start,"amber ones, aggressive targets, military capability, delivery timeframe, project managers, struggling to hold times",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 4.
"The Defence Sub-Committee chaired by Mr Francois made the recommendation that, while we might still task the project teams that way, we should be holding reserves at a higher level and, in particular, doing so on schedule. We have accepted that recommendation and are implementing that across the board. We are moving to hold more contingency in terms of the overall schedules, but we will still drive the teams aggressively because we want to get the capability into the hands of users.",314,Q106,Andy Start,"Defence Sub-Committee recommendation, reserves at a higher level, implementing recommendation, holding more contingency, overall schedules, driving teams aggressively, getting capability into the hands of users","I would rate the sentiment in the paragraph as a 7.5. The overall tone seems positive, as they have accepted a recommendation and are implementing it across the board. Although there is mention of driving teams aggressively, it is stated in a way that conveys a sense of determination and urgency rather than negativity."
You are in charge of that contingency. You are not giving it away easily.,315,Q107,Chair,"responsibility, difficulty","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 7.5. The statement suggests a moderately positive sentiment indicating that the person being addressed is being trusted with a significant responsibility and expected to handle it carefully. However, there is also a slight element of caution or hesitation expressed by the phrase ""You are not giving it away easily."""
"Yes, indeed. That is the key dynamic. If I may, why do we have so many?",316,Q107,Andy Start,"key dynamic, number of reasons",5
We asked for examples. Can you give us some examples?,317,Q108,Chair,examples,"The sentiment expressed in the paragraph is neutral, as it simply asks for examples without expressing any positive or negative emotions. Therefore, the rating would be 5."
"Let me take the example of Boxer. Boxer is currently amber. This is the MIV programme. On the Boxer programme, we are currently just holding the IOC---initial operating capability---dates that we have committed to, but they are under pressure. They are under pressure, as are most of the programmes here, because of issues with supply chain componentry.

"As we came out of Covid, as industry bounced back, the car industry, the commercial aviation industry and others sucked out a lot of the component capacity as they started to rebuild their industries.

"That means they are suddenly under real pressure to maintain the schedule because they cannot get the components in the timeframe. That is starting to wash out at the component level and is now sitting at the subsystem and assembly level. Across our suppliers, we are seeing real issues in that space.",320,Q108,Andy Start,"schedule pressure, component availability, subsystem and assembly issues, supplier issues",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"The second common issue that is driving all of them to feel pressure at the moment is skills. We have a very hot market globally for these engineering skills. Getting those skills into the defence industry is a real challenge. We need to work that skills issue in nuclear. My predecessor Sir Simon Bollom is working on that in the nuclear space.

"Yes, in principle. I would need to check that.",326,Q110,David Williams,"possibility, confirmation",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. The response seems neutral and lacks a clear positive or negative sentiment.
"We have previously had access to the entire strategic suppliers information. Admittedly, that was under a humble address of the House.",327,Q110,Chair,"access to strategic suppliers information, humble address of the House","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the given paragraph as a 5.5. The tone seems moderately neutral, as it mentions past access to information, but acknowledges that it was done in a humble address of the House."
You could save us going to all that trouble.,328,Q110,Mr Francois,"saving time, avoiding hassle, potential solution",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as approximately a 6.

"In terms of what we are doing on internal governance, the Minister for Defence Procurement has now started a regular GMPP review meeting with a particular focus on the reds and ambers trending down. At the delivery end in DE&S there is a programme of project review meetings led by non-executive directors on Mr Start's board. We have followed up on some of the Sheldon recommendations about ensuring that senior responsible owners have a direct route into me or senior sponsors in head office where they are concerned about progress. We are taking the delivery governance seriously.",336,Q111,David Williams,"internal governance, Minister for Defence Procurement, GMPP review meeting, reds and ambers trending down, delivery end in DE&S, project review meetings, non-executive directors, Mr Start's board, Sheldon recommendations, senior responsible owners, direct route, me or senior sponsors, head office, progress, delivery governance","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7. While it is not overly positive, there is a sense of commitment and seriousness expressed in terms of internal governance."
"Can I just add one extra thing to what Mr Start said, just to bring it to life further? You gave credit to DNS staff under Mr Start for what they have done in Ukraine.",337,Q111,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"Mr. Start's statement, Adding additional information, Credit to DNS staff in Ukraine",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"Yes, absolutely right.",338,Q111,Mr Francois,agreement,I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 8.
"I can name three programmes in the DMPP that are red, which would go green tomorrow morning if we were going to war tomorrow night. We would be able to deliver FASGW-heavy, Brimstone 3 and SPEAR cap 3, if we needed to, but we are not prepared to take the level of risk that we are taking in Ukraine. We just need to ensure that we are comparing apples with apples.",339,Q111,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"DMPP programmes, red programmes, going green tomorrow morning, war tomorrow night, delivering FASGW-heavy, delivering Brimstone 3, delivering SPEAR cap 3, readiness for risk in Ukraine, comparing apples with apples.",3
"Can we take a bit more risk, then?",340,Q111,Mr Francois,"risk tolerance, question",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5.
Let us not digress into other topics.,341,Q111,Chair,digression,I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"I will move on to supply chain constraints. I am going to start off with paragraph 2.5 of the NAO Report. It says, ""The MoD is also facing supply chain risks and industry capacity constraints, mainly due to skills gaps, shortages of key components and an increased demand for defence equipment in other countries in response to the war in Ukraine"".",342,Q112,Mr Djanogly,"supply chain constraints, NAO Report, MoD, supply chain risks, industry capacity constraints, skills gaps, shortages of key components, increased demand for defence equipment",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 4.
"It then gives a series of examples, one of which is that the Army has said the lead time for the delivery of semiconductors has increased from one to three weeks to more than 50 weeks. Mr Williams, from your point of view, has the NAO report got it right? Are there these supply constraints that it is talking about? What impact are they having on delivery of equipment plan projects?",343,Q112,Mr Djanogly,"examples, Army's lead time for semiconductor delivery, NAO report, supply constraints, impact on delivery of equipment plan projects","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. It seems to be neutral, as it presents factual information regarding supply constraints without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment."
"Yes, they have got it right. That specific example around the Army experience and access to semiconductors is directly relevant to the Boxer example that Mr Start talked about.",344,Q112,David Williams,"Military technology, semiconductor access, relevance",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"We have put in place a number of processes to give us better visibility below the prime contractor level of our supply chain, including up to around 700 companies that are active in the UK defence supply chain. We have been developing a measure of supply chain fragility or vulnerability. Given your role on the Defence Suppliers Forum, Mr Start, I wonder whether you might want to expand on that.",345,Q112,David Williams,"supply chain visibility, UK defence supply chain, supply chain fragility or vulnerability, Defence Suppliers Forum",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"This is a very different world to the one that we lived in five years ago. There is no doubt significantly more pressure on raw materials and raw material access. Because of the war in Ukraine, there is incredible demand for existing products and equipment. That is pressuring down through the supply chain.",346,Q112,Andy Start,"changing world, increased pressure on raw materials and access, war in Ukraine, increased demand for products and equipment, supply chain pressure",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 4.
"As a consequence of that, we have been having to work with the large primes within the Defence Suppliers Forum. The DSF covers about 80 companies directly and then the whole of the supply chain through the trade associations. We have been working with the large companies to make sure their supply chain teams are discussing supply chain fragility.",347,Q112,Andy Start,"consequence of working with large primes, Defence Suppliers Forum, companies in DSF, supply chain, trade associations, supply chain fragility",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"We have also changed the defence conditions or DEFCONs. Within contracts, the primes now have to provide us with visibility of the supply chain at least four levels down. We have created a supply chain visibility toolset, which now allows us to map this very complex web of interrelated suppliers both onshore and offshore. We can now see where things map.",348,Q112,Andy Start,"changing defence conditions, supply chain visibility, supply chain mapping",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
That goes four tiers down.,349,Q113,Chair,"depth, quantity/frequency",8
"Yes. For the most critical products we have also started to place investment in the supply chain where there have been weaknesses and issues, particularly in things like munitions.",350,Q113,Andy Start,"investment in supply chain, weaknesses and issues in supply chain, critical products, munitions",7
"Within the Government's commitment to £560 million over two years in terms of improving defence resilience, we have been spending that money on not only enhancing production capacity but also working down through the supply chain particularly around chemicals, chemical supply and so on.",351,Q113,Andy Start,"government commitment, improving defence resilience, spending money, enhancing production capacity, working down through the supply chain, chemicals, chemical supply",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"I will come back to the foreign aspect, which we have not really covered yet, but to what extent are you reliant on delays that result in short-term savings but long-term overall cost increases? In the NAO Report, the Type 23 frigate, where repair costs have increased by £23 million to £100 million, is given as an example. To what extent are you using short-term savings but, as a result of that, then being hit for much larger costs down the line?",352,Q114,Mr Djanogly,"1. Foreign aspect
2. Reliance on delays
3. Short-term savings
4. Long-term overall cost increases
5. NAO Report
6. Type 23 frigate
7. Repair costs
8. Short-term savings
9. Larger costs down the line","I would rate the sentiment expressed in this paragraph at around a 3 on the scale. The tone seems negative and critical, expressing concern about relying on delays and short-term savings that may lead to larger costs in the long run."
We have to balance the budget in any particular year. That always creates pressures on spend-to-save things that we would like to do but just cannot. That is a dynamic of defence. We have to make those decisions. We try to prioritise the things that will give us the greatest benefit.,353,Q114,Andy Start,"- Balancing the budget
- Pressures on spend-to-save things
- Defense dynamics
- Making decisions
- Prioritizing beneficial things",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.5
The other dynamic we are facing at the moment is that we are seeing a very high operational tempo of our use of military assets. That means a number of assets that should be in for scheduled maintenance are not because they are out on operational deployment. We are building up something of a maintenance debt that we are going to have to work through as well. There are a few of those dynamics.,354,Q114,Andy Start,"operational tempo, use of military assets, scheduled maintenance, operational deployment, maintenance debt",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 4.
"It is reflected in our equipment plan, if you look at paragraphs 1.21 and 1.22 in the report. The phrase we use is ""management adjustment for realism"".",355,Q114,David Williams,"equipment plan, paragraphs 1.21 and 1.22, ""management adjustment for realism""",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"In putting the plans together, frontline commands, in conjunction with Mr Start's delivery teams or delivery teams elsewhere, will make an assessment of the realism of being able to deliver the programme in totality. Because we do not want to underspend---we want to get as much capability as we can for the budget---that is being factored in particularly within the early years of the programme.",356,Q114,David Williams,"putting plans together, frontline commands, Mr Start's delivery teams, delivery teams elsewhere, assessment of realism, delivering the programme, underspend, getting as much capability as possible, budget, being factored in, early years of the programme",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
It is not particularly a deliberate slowing down of any one programme but an assumption that the totality of the programme overall will probably arrive later than we have programmed.,357,Q114,David Williams,"slowing down of programs, assumption of delayed arrival of programs","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. This is because the statement does not convey a highly positive or negative sentiment, but rather a neutral tone. The use of words like ""not particularly"" and ""assumption"" suggest some level of uncertainty or potential delay, but there is no strong emotional leaning towards either a negative or positive outcome."
"It is certainly not deliberate in terms of the operational aspects you mentioned and things being used. General, what are the capability implications of equipment being used and therefore not being replaced?",358,Q115,Mr Djanogly,"operational aspects, equipment capability, equipment replacement",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. The language used is relatively neutral and does not display a strong positive or negative sentiment.
"That is why we have a replenishment programme for Ukraine. Mr Start and the team have got at that, particularly with regards to some of our missile defence systems but more broadly as well. We know we have to either replenish or take operational risk. That is why we have been given additional funding to do that twice, in both the autumn statement and the spring statement.",359,Q115,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"replenishment programme for Ukraine, missile defence systems, operational risk, additional funding.",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"Last week, on 15 January, as part of the ""Defending the UK and Allies"" statement, our colleague Jack Lopresti asked the Prime Minister, ""Is it not time that we upscaled our industrial defence capacity so that we can continue to support our friends in Ukraine and replenish our own stocks?""",360,Q116,Mr Djanogly,"Defence capacity, Support for Ukraine, Industrial defence, Replenishing stocks.",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 8.5.
"The Prime Minister's reply was, ""That is an excellent point. In a word, yes. That is why we have invested £2.5 billion in rebuilding our stockpiles. Beyond the money, we do need to build our defence industrial capability. That is a challenge shared across NATO that I have discussed extensively with partners, including the NATO Secretary-General. Of course, part of our agreement with Ukraine is how we can mutually help to support and grow our defence industrial complexes"".",361,Q116,Mr Djanogly,"Prime Minister's reply, Rebuilding stockpiles, Defence industrial capability, NATO partnership, Agreement with Ukraine","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as an 8.5. The Prime Minister's response seems positive and confident, indicating that they believe their government is effectively addressing defense and industrial capabilities, both domestically and within NATO."
"Could someone---is it one for Mr Start?---please explain what the Prime Minister meant when he said ""mutually help to support and grow our defence industrial complexes""?",362,Q116,Mr Djanogly,Prime Minister's statement on defence industrial complexes,I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"One of my roles is to lead a programme called Project Hirst, which is our project of supporting Ukraine to build its defence industrial capability, its ability to domestically support the fight, while working in conjunction with UK industry.",363,Q116,Andy Start,"- Role in supporting Ukraine
- Project Hirst
- Building defence industrial capability
- Domestic support in the fight
- Collaboration with UK industry",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"Using a combination of UK funds and UK Export Finance, we are in the process of supporting UK industry to forum partnerships, joint ventures or other commercial arrangements with Ukrainian companies. Together with Ukraine, we are building industrial capacity for the fight. There are some real benefits to that.",364,Q116,Andy Start,"Supporting UK industry, UK Export Finance, forming partnerships and joint ventures, commercial arrangements, building industrial capacity","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 8.5. The overall sentiment is positive, as it discusses supporting UK industry and building partnerships with Ukrainian companies for the fight. The statement also highlights the ""real benefits"" of this effort. However, it is not extremely enthusiastic or effusive, hence the rating is not a perfect 10."
In Ukraine?,365,Q116,Mr Djanogly,Ukraine,"I'm sorry, but I cannot accurately rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph ""In Ukraine?"" without any context or content."
"It is building capability both here and in Ukraine. I was out in Kyiv just before Christmas running the first of a series of conferences between the UK defence industry and the Ukrainian defence industry. I was pleased to be joined by the Ukrainian Defence Minister and their Minister for strategic supply, as we worked together to build up that capacity together.",366,Q116,Andy Start,"building capability, UK defence industry, Ukrainian defence industry, conferences, Ukrainian Defence Minister, Minister for strategic supply, capacity building","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 9. It appears to be very positive and optimistic about building capability and capacity in both the UK and Ukraine. The use of phrases like ""pleased to be joined"" and ""worked together"" suggests a cooperative and collaborative attitude, indicating a positive sentiment."
I talked to you earlier on about the fact that in the fight some technologies are evolving every 90 days. The benefit that our industry gets from working with the Ukrainian industry is that real operational feedback into how its products are working and how it needs to adapt over time. That will make us more competitive in export as well as ensuring that our products adapt and remain relevant in the fight against Russia and others.,367,Q116,Andy Start,"technology evolution, collaboration with Ukrainian industry, operational feedback, product adaptation, competitiveness in export, relevance in fight against Russia and others",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 8.
"I totally get that in terms of the cutting edge, but not all of it is cutting edge, like NLAWs or 155-millimetre shells. I understand that the Ukraine provision is being paid for from a separate pot, in effect. However, it is still coming from the same factories. Is there enough to go around, even if we can pay for it?",368,Q117,Mr Djanogly,"cutting edge technology, NLAWs, 155-millimetre shells, Ukraine provision, separate funding, same factories, availability",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"There is no question that industrial capacity across Europe is stretched, particularly in some areas like 155-millimetre munitions. Over the last 12 months, as part of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, I have been working with my national armament director colleagues to build that capacity in both physical continental Europe and the US to increase industrial capacity.",369,Q117,Andy Start,"industrial capacity across Europe, 155-millimetre munitions, Ukraine Defense Contact Group, physical continental Europe, US, increase industrial capacity",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"An example of that in the UK was our investment in increasing the capacity of our 155-millimetre munition manufacturing capability with BAE Systems, under our long-term partnering agreement with BAE Systems. We have increased that capacity eightfold by investing in its underlying manufacturing capacity to support both our need and the need for Ukraine.",370,Q117,Andy Start,"investment in increasing capacity, 155-millimetre munition manufacturing capability, BAE Systems, long-term partnering agreement, increased capacity eightfold, investing in manufacturing capacity, supporting the need for Ukraine",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"As things stand, can the British public be satisfied that, if there was a war tomorrow, we would have enough 155-millimetre shells?",371,Q118,Mr Djanogly,"satisfaction of British public, availability of 155-millimeter shells, possibility of war tomorrow",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 4.
"In conjunction with our allies---we have pooled capacity in those critical munitions with allies---we have enough capability to fight, if we needed to.",372,Q118,Andy Start,"capacity of critical munitions with allies, capability to fight","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 7.5. The statement seems to express confidence in the collaboration and cooperation with allies, indicating a positive and reassuring outlook. However, the mention of needing to fight can slightly diminish the positivity of the sentiment."
It is important to recognise that one of the reasons for that is that the adversary that is identified as our highest threat is currently engaged in a war with Ukraine. That is attritting its capability. Anything that we do to support Ukraine degrades our greatest potential adversary.,373,Q118,Andy Start,"Reasons for adversary engagement with Ukraine, attrition of adversary capability, supporting Ukraine degrades potential adversary",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"General Magowan, would you like to add to that?",374,Q118,Mr Djanogly,"General Magowan, adding to statement","As an AI language model, I do not possess personal opinions or emotions. Therefore, I am unable to rate the sentiment expressed in the given statement."
"Yes, a couple of things. First of all, we would have to have a closed session, understandably, on where we hold risk in the so-called TSR---the total stockpile requirement---against the state-on-state threat that Mr Start has been talking about. We are very happy to do that. Clearly, we would not want to do that in public.",375,Q118,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"closed session on risk, TSR, state-on-state threat, Mr Start, holding risk, stockpile requirement",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"The second point I would make is that I hate to predict the future, but I do not think NATO would be fighting in the way that the Ukrainians, unfortunately, are having to fight against the Russians in their own country. It would be a different fight. There would be a different demand on 155. That is all I would say at this point.",376,Q118,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"NATO, future prediction, Ukrainian-Russian conflict, fighting tactics, demand on 155",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"My role in Mr Start's plan is to ensure that, as much as possible, there is a commonality of operational requirements between our requirements and Ukraine's because that adds to industrial resilience.",377,Q118,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"role in Mr Start's plan, commonality of operational requirements, industrial resilience",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"Lastly, to answer your point directly about whether the British public should be confident that we can produce these stockpiles, we should think of an exponential curve going that way. It is going to take some time to ramp up from where we were five years ago to where we need to be. It is accelerating, but it is going to take a number of years, in certain cases, to get to the level that we need to reach against the total stockpile requirement for full warfighting.",378,Q118,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"confidence in producing stockpiles, ramping up production, time required, acceleration of production, reaching required level of stockpile",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. The statement is neither extremely positive nor extremely negative. It acknowledges the need for time and effort to reach the desired level but also emphasizes the potential for progress and acceleration.
"Looking at it from the other side of the coin, from the manufacturers' point of view, they also need confidence that, if they are going to build new plants, those are going to be used. From your conversations with them, Mr Start, are they feeling confident about increasing their capability?",379,Q119,Mr Djanogly,"- Manufacturers' perspective on building new plants
- Confidence in utilization of new plants
- Mr. Start's conversations with manufacturers
- Manufacturers' confidence in increasing capability",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"As per my conversation earlier on with Mrs Drummond, the industry is looking for a long-term commitment from Government to help it underpin its investment strategy. Together with industry, we have developed a munitions strategy that allows it to get the visibility that it needs. Our intent is to underwrite that in the long-term plan, which then creates the ability for it to scale up capability to meet the UK need.",380,Q119,Andy Start,"- Conversation with Mrs Drummond
- Industry seeking commitment from Government
- Investment strategy
- Munitions strategy
- Visibility
- Long-term plan
- Scaling up capability
- Meeting the UK need",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 8.
"To meet the Ukrainian need, we are working with it to provide as much visibility as we can about what Ukraine needs and sharing that with our other allies to help create the stimulus where they can invest. Certainly, in my conversations with chief execs, they are keen to invest, if we can give them enough clarity and certainty, and we are working hard to do that.",381,Q119,Andy Start,"Ukrainian need, visibility of Ukraine needs, sharing with allies, stimulus for investment, conversations with chief execs, investment clarity and certainty",6.5
The munitions strategy that Mr Start just mentioned was co-written between us and industry.,382,Q119,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"munitions strategy, Mr Start, co-written, us and industry","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 7 out of 10. The tone seems generally positive, indicating collaboration and partnership between the author and industry. However, the lack of further information or context makes it difficult to determine the overall sentiment accurately."
"Does it become easier if, as the Prime Minister said, we are going to be working across NATO?",383,Q120,Mr Djanogly,"Prime Minister's statement, working across NATO",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"It is absolutely easier if we do it across NATO. We are doing that as far as is possible within the current commitments under the Conference of National Armaments Directors, on which I sit.",384,Q120,Andy Start,"easier implementation across NATO, current commitments under Conference of National Armaments Directors, personal involvement and participation in the committee",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"We are keen to see the nations continue to work together to give a clear signal around their long-term commitment to Ukraine over the next five years or so. The stronger we can make those commitments, the easier it is for industry to make the investments it needs and to ramp up the capacity that we would all like to see.",385,Q120,Andy Start,"long-term commitment to Ukraine, working together, clear signal, industry investments, ramp up capacity",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as an 8.
"Permanent Secretary, if I may take you back to recruitment and retention, it is clearly a big problem at the moment. You must be looking at different assessments and at the way in which you can review what is going on and what the problems are at the core in the Department at the moment.",386,Q121,Gary Sambrook,"recruitment and retention, problem, assessments, review, core, Department","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6. The speaker acknowledges that recruitment and retention is a big problem, but does not express a particularly positive or negative sentiment overall."
"There are significant numbers of people leaving. When you are walking around the Department, you must be looking at people and thinking, ""Why are they leaving?""",387,Q121,Gary Sambrook,"significant numbers of people leaving, observations at the Department, reasons for leaving",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"There are a range of issues. I do not have with me the annual survey, AFCAS, but as part of that we ask a series of questions about which aspects of service life are retention-positive and which are retention-negative. We get quite a good feel from across the service population about the factors of their experience and, within the Armed Forces, what drives people to stay or to go. That is published. I would be happy to share it with the Committee, but I do not have it with me today.",388,Q121,David Williams,"issues, annual survey (AFCAS), aspects of service life, retention-positive and retention-negative aspects, service population, factors of experience, Armed Forces, staying or going decision, publication",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"There is a question around the wider economic situation. This is not an excuse, but we saw exit levels drop off quite markedly during Covid. More people were staying than is usual. Some of the effect that we are seeing is a correction of that period, but it is now stabilising at a level that is higher than the historic norm.",389,Q121,David Williams,"wider economic situation, exit levels during Covid, people staying, effect of Covid, correction of period, stabilizing at higher level than historic norm",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6 out of 10.
"From the answers we have been given today, a lot of the problems that people have been focusing on are caused by issues of retention and recruitment. The findings of that report should probably be imprinted at the forefront of your mind when walking around, making decisions and informing Ministers.",390,Q122,Gary Sambrook,"problems of retention and recruitment, findings of a report, decision-making, informing Ministers",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
How far is your work to improve the number of senior responsible owners undermined by the inability to provide them with supporting teams?,391,Q122,Gary Sambrook,"work improvement, number of senior responsible owners, inability to provide supporting teams","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 4. This is because while there is a recognition of the need to improve the number of senior responsible owners, the mention of the inability to provide them with supporting teams suggests frustration or hinderance in achieving this goal."
It is important to get the right support for SROs in terms of both the direct support that they get from programme directors in their immediate teams and the wider support that they get from delivery teams in Mr Start's organisation as well. That is part of the issue there.,392,Q122,David Williams,support for SROs,I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 6.
"As part of our work on the broader procurement model, the broader operating model, there are other challenges for SROs around their direct control of projects in their programmes, which does not sit neatly with the way in which money flows around the organisation in our current setup, and the range of influence they have across all of the lines of development that go to make successful programme delivery. That is one factor but only one factor.",393,Q122,David Williams,"broader procurement model, broader operating model, challenges for SROs, direct control of projects, money flows, current setup, range of influence, lines of development, successful programme delivery, one factor",6.
"We have made good progress over the past year in increasing the proportion of SRO time that is spent on delivering programmes. We are now up at the 90% mark for SROs who are spending at least 50% of their time on major programmes. Where it is lower, they will be dealing with programmes that are allied or related capabilities. We are supporting them through training and accreditation, including of their programme directors. It is a live issue, but one that we are taking steps to address.",394,Q122,David Williams,"progress in increasing proportion of SRO time spent on delivering programmes, 90% mark for SROs spending at least 50% of their time on major programmes, lower proportion of time spent on allied or related capabilities, support through training and accreditation, addressing the issue",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 8.
"Last week we learned that the Royal Navy's support arm was being forced to use Serco to recruit deckhands. This is the first time in history that the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is not going to be directly employing people on Navy and Royal Marines vessels. This is going to cost you more money and it is not particularly conducive to keeping a good workforce in order either. This is not sustainable, is it?",395,Q123,Gary Sambrook,"recruitment process, Royal Navy, support arm, Serco, Royal Fleet Auxiliary, employment, Navy and Royal Marines vessels, cost, workforce, sustainability","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. The paragraph expresses a mix of negative and neutral sentiments. While it highlights negative aspects such as increased cost and potential negative impact on workforce, it also includes neutral statements about a change in employment practices."
My understanding of that particular case is that we have a contract with Serco for certain port and dockside capabilities. I do not think that job advert is indicative of the health of recruiting potential in the RFA.,396,Q123,David Williams,"contract with Serco, port and dockside capabilities, job advert, health of recruiting potential in the RFA",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"Just to be clear, Mr Williams, you are saying that the story was not accurate.",397,Q124,Chair,"accuracy of the story, statement clarification","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5, as it appears to be neutral."
"Yes, I think that is what I am saying.",398,Q124,David Williams,"personal opinion, confirmation, clarification of statement",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5. The statement seems neutral and does not convey a particularly positive or negative sentiment.
Let us call a spade a spade. Let us be clear that we are not asking private companies to provide people to serve on Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships.,399,Q125,Chair,"naming, clarifying, asking for services, private companies, Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"Again, the Permanent Secretary referred to this at the beginning. One of the major recruitment challenges is that we need to invoke greater flexibility in Armed Forces careers. We are in a different environment to when I joined the Royal Marines, 525 years ago.",400,Q125,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"Permanent Secretary, recruitment challenges, flexibility in Armed Forces careers, different environment, Royal Marines",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"We are in a position where we have to offer zig-zag careers or whatever it might be. Again, we do not have the report here, but quite often the reason people give for leaving is ""inability to manage my own life"". That answer is more prevalent now than it was decades ago. We are getting after that. That is what the Haythornthwaite review identified.",401,Q125,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"zig-zag careers, reasons for leaving, inability to manage own life, Haythornthwaite review",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 6.
"General, we are not alone in this challenge. There are reports of similar challenges with recruitment in the US. You want the best of the best. You want to be able to serve alongside the best of the best. In recent years, has there been too much emphasis on equality of output rather than equality of opportunity in terms of recruitment?",402,Q126,Gary Sambrook,"General, challenges with recruitment in the US, best of the best, serving alongside the best of the best, emphasis on equality of output, equality of opportunity in recruitment.",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
Do you want to explain what you mean by that?,403,Q126,Chair,inquiring about clarification,"I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. It is a neutral statement where the speaker simply seeks clarification or further explanation, without any overtly positive or negative tone."
"We have been looking at a more diverse range of people to go into the forces in particular, which is on one hand a good thing. When that becomes the sole focus of a recruitment campaign, that does not necessarily always yield results.",404,Q126,Gary Sambrook,"diverse range of people for forces, recruitment campaign, results","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6 out of 10. It is generally positive, acknowledging the importance of diversity in the forces. However, there is also a slight hint of skepticism or concern about solely focusing on diversity in recruitment campaigns."
"Let me bring it home to the Royal Marines. About four or five years ago, the Royal Marines, along with the other frontline capability in the Armed Forces, welcomed women to join. Our view in the Royal Marines is that a diverse team is a stronger team. There is quite a lot of evidence that a narrow team can develop groupthink. Greater diversity, whatever it might be, whether it be gender or race, delivers a stronger and more challenging team.",405,Q126,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"- Royal Marines opening up to women
- Importance of diversity in teams
- Groupthink dangers of narrow teams
- Benefits of diversity in terms of gender and race",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 9.5. The person expresses a very positive sentiment towards diversity and emphasizes the benefits it brings to a team.
I would refute that it is a distraction. It is something we should absolutely be getting after. History shows that it is a strength.,406,Q126,Lt General Sir Robert Magowan,"distraction, importance of pursuit, strength of pursuing",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"Finally, Mr Start, the report states that you have identified 20 roles where you do not have the number of skilled staff you need, which included project managers, commercial staff, data scientists, business analysts and engineers. These are all highly competitive roles. Why can we not keep them or even recruit them?",407,Q127,Gary Sambrook,"- Identified roles with shortage of skilled staff: project managers, commercial staff, data scientists, business analysts, engineers
- Highly competitive roles
- Lack of ability to retain or recruit skilled staff",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 6.
"We are able to recruit them. If we are focusing on the Civil Service, we are able to recruit them, but we do have a slow and steady attrition of this skillset. Why do we have a slow and steady attrition? It is because these are very attractive skills that are wanted in many industries that are currently vibrant. There are very low levels of unemployment. There is a lot of competition for these kinds of jobs. Fundamentally, we need more, coming out of our colleges and universities, to meet the national demand. It is an overall supply and demand issue.",408,Q127,Andy Start,"- Recruitment, Civil Service, Slow and steady attrition, Skillset, Unemployment, Competition, College and university graduates, National demand, Supply and demand issue",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"What are we doing about it? We are trying to be clear that, while other people may pay more in some circumstances, we offer a competitive package that is a mixture of a good salary, a good pension and, most importantly, work that is genuinely meaningful, rewarding and enjoyable. We are hoping that message attracts more and more not just to DNS but to the wider defence industry, which is desperately in need of more skills.",409,Q127,Andy Start,"attracting talent, competitive package, salary, pension, meaningful work, rewarding work, enjoyable work, defense industry, skills shortage","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 8. The overall tone is positive and enthusiastic, emphasizing the benefits and value of the package offered and the importance of attracting skilled individuals to the defense industry."
"Mr Start, General Magowan said earlier that we need a much stronger industrial base and you have said there is an assembly issue with some projects. We are seeing a decline in the UK manufacturing base as a whole. We have heard the news about Port Talbot steelworks closing. What is the MoD doing to secure the defence manufacturing sector in the future, particularly around bringing in skilled workers, such as apprentices, welders and platers, to secure the supply chain in the future?",410,Q128,Sarah Owen,"- Industrial base
- Assembly issue with some projects
- Decline in UK manufacturing base
- Port Talbot steelworks closing
- Defence manufacturing sector
- Skilled workers (apprentices, welders, and platers)
- Securing the supply chain in the future",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.5.
"Defence overall has an underlying industrial strategy that articulates its aspiration and then breaks that down into sector strategies covering each of the major areas of defence. In the shipbuilding space, for example, we have the National Shipbuilding Office, which is trying to blend the needs of UK military with the private sector.",411,Q128,Andy Start,"Defence overall, underlying industrial strategy, aspiration, sector strategies, shipbuilding space, National Shipbuilding Office, needs of UK military, private sector",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"We have done pretty well in shipbuilding. If you go back a decade, we had one plant that was actively manufacturing defence warships for the nation. We now have three. Each of those is building in more skills with skills academies that underpin them. Within that sector, there has been a really good story.",412,Q128,Andy Start,"shipbuilding, manufacturing, defence warships, plants, skills academies, sector, story",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as an 8.
"There are challenges. For example, there are not enough master welders to teach the apprentices. That creates a challenge for us. There is a rite of passage that you have to go through and learning takes time, but we are trying to work that as actively as we can with industry to help stimulate it. Where appropriate, Government have been doing their best to support them.",413,Q128,Andy Start,"Challenges, Lack of master welders, Apprenticeship, Rite of passage, Learning takes time, Collaboration with industry, Government support",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7. The overall tone is positive as the speaker acknowledges the challenges but also emphasizes efforts to address them and the support from the government.
"You say ""stimulate"". If it is a question of time, you cannot just rush people through the training to become a master welder.",414,Q129,Chair,"stimulate, time, rush, training, master welder",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 5.
"Yes. The dynamic is about working with them to create the academies, to encourage as many master welders into the system as we can and to be flexible where necessary to bring capabilities from partners and allies. For example, when we have managed to sell our design to an overseas shipyard, we work collaboratively with that shipyard but also encourage them to bring skills and capabilities into the UK and enhance our capabilities. That is what we have been doing in the maritime domain, which has been quite strong.",415,Q129,Andy Start,"working with partners and allies, creating academies, encouraging master welders, flexibility in bringing in capabilities, working collaboratively, enhancing capabilities, maritime domain",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as an 8.
"In the land sector, we have the land industrial strategy. To be honest, we have seen a renaissance in our capability from almost nothing in the UK, where we had seen it wither on the vine, to a capability where we are now very active with the building of Boxer. There are multiple manufacturing plants working on the Boxer programme. The Challenger 3 programme is very active and so on.",416,Q129,Andy Start,"land industrial strategy, renaissance in capability, UK, withering on the vine, capability, active, Boxer, manufacturing plants, Challenger 3 programme","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 8 out of 10. The speaker seems to express a positive sentiment towards the progress and capabilities in the land sector, highlighting the growth and activity in the building of Boxer and the Challenger 3 program."
"We are seeing good efforts. We are trying to work with industry through both our industrial strategy and the Defence Suppliers Forum in order to have a coherent plan with industry. It is a big job of work. The truth of the matter is that it is a challenging global environment. That is going to drive overall increased spending in this sector, and therefore we have to build industrial capacity.",417,Q129,Andy Start,"Efforts, working with industry, industrial strategy, Defence Suppliers Forum, coherent plan, big job, challenging global environment, increased spending, industrial capacity",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"I know time is tight, but I would really welcome if you could write to the Committee and explain some of those challenges, particularly the shortfalls around master welders and the very high-skilled jobs in defence manufacturing that we are looking at, and how we are going to get through that.",418,Q129,Sarah Owen,"time constraints, request for writing to the Committee, challenges in defence manufacturing, shortfalls in master welders and high-skilled jobs, plan for addressing the challenges.",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"It is an important pillar of defence strategy to have an industrial strategy. When you talked about volatility earlier, Mr Start, there is volatility, but some of this is about long-term planning and pipelines, which is of concern to us.",419,Q129,Chair,"defence strategy, industrial strategy, volatility, long-term planning, pipelines, concern","I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.5. The statement acknowledges the importance of having an industrial strategy and recognizes the concern about long-term planning and pipelines. However, the mention of volatility indicates some level of negativity or uncertainty. Overall, the sentiment leans slightly more towards the positive side but with caution."
"I have two very brief things to mop up. Mr Wipperman, on figure 14, further to the questions by Mr Djanogly and Ms Owen on building manufacturing capacity, is that £5.01 billion a commitment in the budget? The NAO Report says that the MoD ""intends"" to invest. Which is it? Is it a commitment or an intention?",420,Q130,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"Mop up of two things, Mr Wipperman on figure 14, commitment of £5.01 billion in the budget, questions on building manufacturing capacity, clarification of commitment or intention",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 4.
"On figure 14, the £560 million is agreed funding from the Treasury. The £1.95 billion is agreed funding from the Treasury. The £2.5 billion is a commitment that was made in the defence command paper refresh in July, which we will invest into the future. That does not represent new funding; it represents how we will reprioritise within the existing budget.",421,Q130,Tom Wipperman,"figure 14, agreed funding from Treasury, £560 million, £1.95 billion, commitment from defence command paper, future investment, reprioritizing existing budget",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 6.
It will come out of the budget in due course.,422,Q131,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,budget allocation,I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5 on the scale. It appears to be a neutral statement without a clear positive or negative connotation.
"Yes, that is right.",423,Q131,Tom Wipperman,confirmation,7
Over what timeframe?,424,Q132,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,Timeframe,"I'm sorry, but without any specific sentiment mentioned in the paragraph, it is not possible to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10. The paragraph simply asks for clarification regarding the timeframe of something, and does not express any positive or negative sentiment."
We are already getting after munitions generally. We are working through that now and we would start to see it in future plans. It might be next year; it might be the year after.,425,Q132,Tom Wipperman,"munitions, future plans",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as 6.5.
"Just to put that in context, against that £560 million, over £400 million of it is already on contract. Against the wider number, we have already spent over £1 billion on replenishment, which is already on contract. A lot of this is underway and there is more to come.",426,Q132,Andy Start,"context, contract, wider number, spending, replenishment, underway, future spending",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 8.
"I have another question for you, Mr Start. In the dreaded GMPP list of red projects---I am asking this question carefully and no doubt you will want to answer it carefully---is there a problem with complex digital communication systems across a range of defence equipment?",427,Q133,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"GMPP list of red projects, question about complex digital communication systems across defence equipment","Based on the provided paragraph, it is difficult to determine a clear sentiment score. However, it seems to convey a cautious or concerned tone rather than a strongly positive or negative sentiment. Therefore, I would rate the sentiment around a 5 on the scale of 1 to 10."
I am going to carefully answer the question by saying that is delivered within Defence Digital and it would be unfair for me to comment. I will let David take the wider question.,428,Q133,Andy Start,"Defence Digital, answering the question, unfair comment, David taking the wider question",4
"There are a range of challenges, and we have had hearings before this Committee before on the digital programme.",429,Q133,David Williams,"range of challenges, hearings before Committee, digital programme",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. It seems to be neutral and does not strongly lean towards either positive or negative sentiment.
We had a whole set of sessions.,430,Q133,Chair,sessions,I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 7.
"Some of the programmes that are particularly challenging are, in my view, at the more basic end of our IT and digital infrastructure.",431,Q133,David Williams,"challenging programmes, basic end, IT and digital infrastructure",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
The basic end?,432,Q134,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"uncertainty, conclusion, ambiguity","I am sorry, but the given phrase does not convey any specific sentiment. It appears to be incomplete and lacks context."
"Let me take the example of the MODNet Evolve programme. We bent out of shape in order to support hybrid and working from home during Covid. It is a programme that includes the delivery of laptops, for instance. We did a really good job in supporting that.",433,Q134,David Williams,"MODNet Evolve programme, support for hybrid and working from home during Covid, delivery of laptops, good job in supporting",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as an 8.
"As a result, some of the other elements of the programme around the management of printed services and moving some of the secret domain to the cloud are taking longer than originally thought. This is not the most technical end, but it is fundamental underpinning infrastructure that has been disrupted through real-world events.",434,Q134,David Williams,"programme management, printed services, secret domain, cloud migration, disruption, infrastructure",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
I wonder whether you are putting a bit of a gloss on that. Let me give you another example. Morpheus does involve complex digital communications. It is not the only one. There are others with complex digital communications.,435,Q135,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,"glossing over, another example, Morpheus, complex digital communications, others",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"On digital transformation programmes generally, we are not alone in Government in this.",436,Q135,David Williams,"digital transformation programmes, Government, not alone",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5. It is neutral and does not strongly lean towards either a positive or negative sentiment.
"We have covered this. Just to be clear, we have done a separate report on this. You can keep your answer brief. We do not need to revisit it.",437,Q135,Chair,"coverage, separate report, answer, revisiting",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 5.
"Yes, there is a challenge. Some of the ones that are red are not at the most challenging end of the spectrum. That is all I meant.",438,Q135,David Williams,"challenge, spectrum",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
They are not the most challenging.,439,Q135,Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,level of difficulty,6
"Not all of them, no.",440,Q135,David Williams,"negation, uncertainty, contradiction",3
"We have an interesting challenge here, if I can put it politely, with the equipment plan. If we look back to last year, there was a £4.3 billion contingency in the plan and the worst-case deficit was just over £7 billion. If you add those two together, it does not even hit the size of £17 billion. It is not enough to close the gap, yet you have been quite buoyant today, as a team. Mr Williams, why are you so buoyant that you can manage this?",441,Q136,Chair,"- Equipment plan challenge
- £4.3 billion contingency
- £7 billion worst-case deficit
- £17 billion size
- Gap closing
- Mr. Williams buoyancy",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
The Defence Secretary gave a speech this time last week around the challenges in the international environment. I am loath to feel buoyant about that. Those are very real and present threats.,442,Q136,David Williams,"Defence Secretary's speech, challenges in the international environment, feeling buoyant, real and present threats.",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 4.
"Against the Government's commitment---although the timeframe is to be decided---that defence spending should increase over time, and against the headmark in capability terms around the exploitation of technology and the changes to our procurement system that we have pointed the way for in the defence command paper refresh last summer, we have a pretty clear idea of where we need to get to and a reasonable chance of having the wherewithal to get there.",443,Q136,David Williams,"Government commitment, defence spending, timeframe, headmark in capability terms, exploitation of technology, changes to procurement system, defence command paper refresh, where we need to get to, reasonable chance of having the wherewithal to get there",7
"Is it a challenging environment? Yes, absolutely. Based on the set of assumptions that we had when this snapshot plan was produced last year, there are a range of affordability challenges that we need to deal with, but we have work in hand to think about our priorities. We are making the case for our budget.",444,Q136,David Williams,"challenging environment, assumptions, affordability challenges, priorities, budget",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7.
"I just need to pick up on that. You are making a case, but you are waiting for the spending review as a major part of achieving this, and there is this assumption that you are going to get 2.5% of GDP for defence spending. You sound very optimistic that those two elements will be part of it, but yet we have not really had any discussion about reducing capability in order to meet the demands of the overall programme.",445,Q137,Chair,"- Picking up on a case
- Waiting for spending review
- Assumption of 2.5% GDP for defence spending
- Optimism about these elements being included
- Lack of discussion about reducing capability for overall programme demands",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6. It is mostly neutral with a slight leaning towards being slightly negative.
We are working through what we need to do next year and maybe the year after to get us to the spending review. My point is simply that deliberately taking things out of the programme against an expectation and a Government policy that the budget will go up is not good value for money or a sensible set of decisions to take from a capability perspective. It is about managing that uncertainty over the next 18 months.,446,Q137,David Williams,"- Planning for next year and the year after
- Spending review
- Value for money
- Government policy
- Budget increase
- Capability perspective
- Managing uncertainty",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 6.
"If you do not get the money, you are going to have to take capability out, are you not?",447,Q138,Chair,"money, capability, taking capability out",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 3.
"Yes, but then a spending review is the proper process by which to have conversations with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor about how much is being invested in defence and what they get back for that investment.",448,Q138,David Williams,"spending review, conversations with Prime Minister, conversations with Chancellor, investment in defence, return on investment",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 7. The speaker acknowledges the need for a spending review and seems optimistic about the opportunity to discuss investment in defense and the subsequent benefits.
"We can go round and round on this. As I said at the beginning, it is a bit like groundhog day. The capability needs and the budget never seem to balance. We have gone over it a lot. We will revisit it again next year, whatever iteration of this Committee there is at that point. If it is in a year's time, there will have been a general election in between. We know that for sure, by today's date.",449,Q138,Chair,"budget, capability needs, balance, Committee, iteration, general election, date",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph as a 3.
Thank you very much indeed for your time. The transcript of this session will be available on the website uncorrected in the next couple of days and we will be producing a Report before the Easter recess. Thank you very much indeed.,450,Q138,Chair,"expression of gratitude, availability of transcript, production of report, timing of report",I would rate the sentiment expressed in the paragraph a 8.
